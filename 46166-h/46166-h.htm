<p class="pn">The salient features and the principal events of the Zulu
war are referred to in this volume. Long and uninteresting
details respecting minor operations are omitted, and an
attempt is made to furnish a readable book, which gives
a fair view of the causes, origin, and progress of the war.
It must be borne in mind that South African Kafir wars
constitute one tragedy in various acts. The Zulu campaigns
are merely last links of a chain. The war with Cetywayo
is identical in principle with those waged with Gaika,
T'Slambie, Dingaan, Kreli, and Sandilli. The tide of
savagery has been periodically rolled back, and it was either
necessary that this should be done, or that white men
should abandon Southern Africa. The fatuous policy of
Lord Glenelg caused the wars of 1846 and 1852, and there
is in essence no difference between it and the policy
advocated by the opponents of Sir Bartle Frere. In order
not to load this introductory note with lengthy observations,
a paper will be found in the Appendix treating upon this
subject.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>Blue Books and correspondents' letters necessarily form
the principal authorities. The preliminary portion of the
book has been really requisite, and it is hoped that it will
be found not the least interesting portion of the volume.
No doubt, in the first connected narrative of the Zulu war,
many omissions and inaccuracies may be discovered, but
every effort has been made to collect the truth from the
most reliable authorities, and to tell it without fear, favour,
or prejudice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">EARLY HISTORY OF THE ZULU NATION AND OF NATAL.</p>

<p class="pn p2">Two different races met in Southern Africa about the
middle of the seventeenth century. One had migrated
from the centre of the continent; the other sent out settlers
from one of the most civilized and prosperous countries
of Europe. These races were the Kafirs and the Dutch.
The former arrived at the banks of the Great Fish River
about the same time that Surgeon Van Riebeek landed on
the shores of Table Bay for the purpose of establishing "a
place of refreshment for the outward and homeward bound
fleets of the chartered Dutch East India Company."
The progress of the new colony was so gradual and slow
that it was not until the nineteenth century that Kafir
irruptions were effectually checked, and then the British
Government had assumed sovereignty over the Cape of
Good Hope. Different causes, to which it is not necessary
to refer, made the descendants of the Dutch settlers so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
dissatisfied with our rule that a portion of them, in the
year 1837, passed into that easterly portion of Southern
Africa styled Natal. There they came in contact with the
bravest and best-organized portion of the great Kafir race.
The Ama-Zulus were originally a small and despised
tribe. They were "tobacco sellers," or pedlars, and carried
on this occupation at the beginning of the present century
in the country between the Black and White Umvolosi
rivers. In contradistinction to the nature of their employment,
and as an emblem of the ambition of the people,
the name they gave themselves was one of the proudest
they could have chosen, as "the Zulus" in the Kafir
tongue signifies "the Celestials." At an early period in
this century a great leader arose among them, who became
the Genghis Khan of Southern Africa. This chief was
fitly named "Utskaka"&mdash;"Chaka," or "Break of Day;" and
it was in consequence of his efforts and of his success that
a new era commenced for his countrymen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Chaka and his army.</i></div>

<p>Chaka was never defeated, and never fled before a foe.
Having ascended the throne by means of the murder of
his uncle, he proceeded at once to convert a nation of
pedlars into a nation of warriors. Immense care was
taken with military training, and the weapon by means
of which the Roman soldiers conquered the world was
adopted for the use of the army. The short sword, or
stabbing assegai, was supplied, with the command that
each warrior should carry but one, and either bring it
back from the battle-field or be put to death as a coward.
Marriage was forbidden, although the gratification of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
brutal lust was allowed. No warrior could have a wife
or child to imbue him with any tender sentiment. The
practice of circumcision, although one of the most ancient
and important rites, was abandoned, so that everything,
no matter how sacred or how important, was sacrificed
in order to create invincible legions. The army consisted
of three divisions. The first was composed of veterans,
styled "amadoda," or men; the second of youths, "ebuto;"
and the third of "ezibuto," or carriers. It was in the last
division that conquered enemies were frequently enrolled.
The king was the commander-in-chief, and under him were
the principal indunas, or ministers of state. Each regiment
was at least 1500 strong, and was led by a captain,
who had under him numerous subalterns. Military kraals
were scattered over the country, generally of an oval shape,
and of large dimensions. Reviews took place at the great
place of the king, where songs, dances, and chivalrous
games were all made use of to increase the military
enthusiasm of the warriors. When war was determined
upon, extreme secrecy was observed, spies were sent out,
and the usual incantations and sacrifices performed by the
priest or witch-doctor. A herald, dressed in the skins of
wild beasts, so as to present a terrific appearance, then
was sent to the army, and cried with a loud voice, "Maiku-puke!"&mdash;"Go
up!" An inspiring oration was delivered by
the king, and they went forth to conquer or to die, fifty
thousand well-organized, determined savages, giving no
quarter, slaying men, women, children, and even domestic
animals. Thus has a warrior described the onset of one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
these savage armies:&mdash;"The Matabele lions raised the
shout of death, and fell upon their victims. It was the
shout of victory. Their hissing and hollow groans told
their progress among the dead. A few moments laid
hundreds on the ground. The clash of shields was the
signal of triumph. They entered the town with the roar
of the lion; they pillaged and fired the houses, speared
the mothers, and cast their infants to the flames. They
slaughtered cattle; they danced and sang till the dawn of
day; they ascended and killed till their hands were weary
of the spear."</p>

<p>Chaka not only led his army in person, but was accustomed
himself to seize the first victim, and to kill him with
his spear. After subduing the petty tribes around, he bore
his victorious arms further, and carried fire and sword
along the slopes of the Drakenberg Mountains. One of his
greatest conquests was over the Undwandwa people, and
this was followed by the destruction of the Umtetwas. An
attack was then made upon the brave Amaquabi, who
occupied both sides of the Tugela river, which forms the
present boundary of Natal. Merciless slaughters followed
victory, and the tide of conquest only ceased on the banks
of the Umsimvoboo.</p>

<p>In the year 1828, Lieutenant Farewell, Mr. H. Fynn,
and a few others, were permitted to visit Chaka, who then
resided at a distance of about 150 miles in a north-north-east
direction from D'Urban, Port Natal. The Englishmen
were received by the mighty Zulu potentate with great ceremony.
Nine thousand armed warriors stood around, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the despotic character of the monarch was reflected in the
servile submission with which he was treated by his subjects.
Chaka munificently granted a large tract of country
to Mr. H. Fynn, and subsequently conferred a similar
favour upon Lieutenant King. These grants&mdash;and all
grants of this nature&mdash;were, strictly speaking, mere feudal
investitures, paramount rights being retained by the
monarch. The first European settlement in Natal was
thus formed. An act of treason on the part of one of
Chaka's greatest lieutenants alienated him from his native
land, and became the means of carrying fire and sword
north of the Drakenberg Mountains as far as Bamangwato.
Moselekatsi, whom Captain Harris styles the "Lion of
the North," was this lieutenant. Wherever he moved destruction
and death marked his path, and he soon succeeded
in rearing another cruel military despotism over the graves
of those whom he had conquered.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Assassination of Chaka.</i></div>

<p>The last army of Chaka which went forth to destroy
was itself destroyed by one of those strange judgments
which bear analogy to that inflicted on the hosts of Sennacherib.
A nation dwelling close to the Palula river had
to be conquered, but before this place was reached a frightful
disease, styled "blood sickness," broke out, and was so
fatal in its results that only a few men of the great army
were able to return to tell the tale. Scarcely had this
event occurred, when the tyrant was himself assassinated.
Chaka was seated peacefully in his kraal, near the Umvoti
river, surrounded by his councillors and principal officers,
when a band of desperate men, headed by his brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Dingaan, rushed among them, and each, seizing his victim,
plunged a spear into his heart. Thus perished the Napoleon
of the Zulu race, by the hand of his own nearest
relative, and at a moment when he did not suspect treachery
or dream of any insurrection against his well-consolidated
power.</p>

<p>Dingaan&mdash;"poor fellow!"&mdash;was no doubt secretly
encouraged by a large portion of the Zulu people. A
number of the principal captains and friends of the late
monarch fled, and several were put to death. The new
capital was removed from the Umvati river to the White
Umvolosi river, distant 45 miles in a direct line from the
sea, and about 160 miles from D'Urban. The favour that
had been extended by Chaka to the few Englishmen who
arrived in Natal with Mr. H. Fynn was a sufficient reason
for the adoption by his successor of an exactly opposite
policy. An army of 3000 men was sent to D'Urban,
and the few English settlers escaped with the utmost
difficulty. Every vestige of property was destroyed.
Quietness was, however, restored in a few years afterwards,
and in the year 1833 Dingaan sent down spies to find out
what progress had been made by the intruders.</p>

<p>Captain Allen Gardiner arrived in 1835, and proceeded
to the great place of the king. This missionary traveller
mentions incidentally that, according to treaty, he brought
back several men who had fled from the cruel despotism of
the Zulu monarch. These captives fully calculated upon
being put to death. Captain Gardiner pleaded for them,
and was able to assure them that the king had promised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to spare their lives. Nowha, one of the unfortunate
prisoners, mournfully replied, "They are killing us
now;" and they were all cruelly tortured to death by
starvation.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Dingaan and the Boers.</i></div>

<p>In consequence of various causes, among which discontent
with British rule requires prominent mention, a
number of Dutch farmers left the Cape Colony in 1835,
and, under the command of Pieter Retief, crossed the Drakensberg
Mountains in 1837, and entered Natal. Their
leader proceeded to Dingaan's capital, for the purpose of
negotiating a treaty of peace and obtaining a formal
cession of territory. In the last week of January, 1838,
Pieter Retief, accompanied by seventy picked horsemen,
crossed the Buffalo river, and on the 2nd of February
arrived at Dingaan's kraal. The Zulu monarch fixed the
4th of February as the day for signing a formal cession of
an immense district in Natal to the emigrant Boers. The
necessary document, drawn out by the Rev. Mr. Owen,
missionary, with Dingaan, was duly signed, and business
having been satisfactorily concluded, the Dutchmen were
invited into the king's kraal to take leave of Dingaan. As
requested, Retief and his followers left their arms outside.
The Zulu monarch, surrounded by his favourite regiments,
conversed in the most friendly manner, and while a
"stirrup cup" of maize beer was in course of being
drunk, suddenly cried out, "Bulala matagati!"&mdash;"Kill
the wizards!" These words were the signal for a cruel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
massacre. More than 3000 savages beat to death, with
knobkerries, the unfortunate Dutchmen who had been
weak enough to trust to Zulu promises and Zulu honesty.
The corpses of the slaughtered men were dragged out of
the kraal to an adjacent hillock, and there allowed to
become the prey of wolves and vultures.</p>

<p>Dingaan looked upon the massacre of the farmers who
had vainly trusted to his honour as only a commencement
of hostilities. Ten regiments were immediately ordered
out to exterminate all the Dutch emigrants. While these
people were, without suspicion, waiting for the return of
their husbands and relatives, a Zulu army crawled up to
their nearest camp, near the Blaauwkrantz river, close to
the present commemorative town of Weenen, or "Weeping."
A sudden surprise at the dawn of day was effected, and
then ensued the barbarous murder in cold blood of every
man, woman, and child. Other detachments surprised
other parties, and few escaped. The destroying army
moved swiftly southward and towards the sea. Wherever
the "laager" plan was adopted, it was successful; and at
"Necht Laager," on the Bushmans river, a few determined
men succeeded in defending themselves against an
overwhelming force of savages. The engagement lasted
all day, but when the farmers' ammunition was nearly
exhausted, the fire from a 3-pounder, rigged at the back
of one of the waggons, killed several Zulu chiefs, and
caused a precipitate retreat. The men who were afterwards
able to visit the principal scenes of slaughter discovered
frightful scenes of horror and misery. Waggons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
were demolished, and by their ruins lay the corpses of
men, women, and children abandoned to the wild beasts.
Among the heaps of dead found at Weenen two young girls
were picked out, one of whom had been pierced by nineteen
assegai stabs, and the other by twenty-one. Both
survived, although they remained cripples for life. It is
estimated that in one week 600 white settlers were
sacrificed as victims to the savage treachery of Dingaan.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Slaughter of English.</i></div>

<p>Vengeance was determined upon by the Dutch emigrants,
and a party of 400, having placed themselves
under the command of Piet Uys and of Hendrik Potgieter,
advanced from the Klip River Division against
Dingaan. This took place in April, 1838; but unfortunately,
shortly before, a party of Englishmen from
D'Urban, with 700 friendly Zulus, having crossed the
Tugela river near its mouth and destroyed a native town,
the army of Dingaan, which had been kept in reserve,
suddenly surrounded them and killed nearly every European.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The conquerors followed up their success as far
as D'Urban, and forced the few white people then resident
there to take refuge on board a vessel named the <i>Comet</i>,
fortunately lying at anchor in the bay. Dingaan, with his
principal forces, watched the Dutch emigrants, and learned
that Piet Uys and Hendrik Potgieter had placed themselves
at the head of 400 men, with the object of invading
Zululand. The wily savage allowed the Dutchmen to
advance to a place closed in between two hills, within a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
few miles of his capital, and thence led them to a valley,
where a desperate hand-to-hand combat took place. The
farmers had been accustomed to fight by firing from horseback,
and then falling back rapidly to reload. They were
so hemmed in by their position, that this mode of procedure
was impossible, and they were at last, in desperation, compelled
to concentrate their fire on one portion of the Zulu
host. They then charged through the gap thus made,
and escaped. Unfortunately, Piet Uys did not succeed in
cutting his way through, and died with his son, fighting
bravely against terrible odds. After this disastrous engagement,
the Boers were so disheartened that hostilities were
for some time suspended. They were renewed in August,
1838, when Dingaan attacked the Dutch in their laagers,
but was in all cases repulsed with loss. Towards the
close of that year, an army of 10,000 Zulus attacked the
Dutch farmers in a strongly intrenched position at the
Umslatoos river. The engagement took place on Sunday,
the 16th of December. For three hours overwhelming
masses of natives endeavoured to force the emigrant camp,
until Pretorius, finding that ammunition was beginning
to fail, ordered 200 men to sally forth on horseback,
and take the enemy in flank. This man&oelig;uvre was successful,
and the forces of Dingaan were compelled to fly,
after leaving a large number on the field.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> After this
decisive battle 5000 head of cattle were captured, and an
advance was made to the hillock where lay the mortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
remains of Retief and the brave men who perished with
him. A frightful and ghastly spectacle was beheld:
broken skulls, on which could be seen the marks of the
knobkerries and stones with which they had been fractured,
bones of legs and arms, and, strange to say, the skeleton
of Retief, recognizable by a leathern pouch or bandoleer, in
which was found the deed signed by Dingaan, resigning
to the emigrant farmers "the place called Port Natal,
together with all the land annexed; that is to say, from
the Tugela to the Umzimvoboo river, and from the sea
to the north, as far as the land may be useful and in my
possession."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Arrival of Major Charteris.</i></div>

<p>On the return of the emigrant Boers from this very
successful attack on the Zulus, they were surprised to find
that a small detachment of Highlanders, under the
command of Major Charteris had taken possession of the
Bay of Natal. This was done by order of Sir George
Napier, Governor of the Cape Colony, from a desire<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> "to
put an end to the unwarranted occupation of parts of the
territories belonging to the natives by certain emigrants of
the Cape Colony, being subjects of his Majesty." No
conflict, however, took place at this time. The Dutch were
busily employed during the year 1839 in laying out the
towns of Pietermaritzburg<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and D'Urban, as well as in
appointing landrosts or magistrates, and establishing regulations
for the government of the country. Dingaan frequently
sent in ambassadors charged with messages of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
peace, but it was soon discovered that this was merely a
plan for carrying out a system of espionage.</p>

<p>A brother of Dingaan, named Panda, who had been
generally looked upon with contempt as a mere sensualist
who was undisposed for the fatigues of warfare, became an
object of jealousy to the king, in consequence of a large
party among the Zulus, who were tired of constant fighting
and bloodshed, showing some disposition to prefer him
to his brother. An attempt to capture and kill Panda
was followed by his flight across the Tugela into Natal,
and his application to the Dutch emigrant farmers for assistance.
Such an opportunity was gladly seized upon;
and in the next year (1840) an army of Panda's, 4000
strong, was joined by 400 mounted farmers, under the
command of Andries Pretorius. While the forces were
mustering in Pietermaritzburg, an ambassador from
Dingaan, named Tamboosa, arrived, bringing proposals for
peace. Upon being seized and questioned, this messenger
admitted that one of the objects of his mission was to
obtain every possible information, with a view of reporting
it to his master. This, however, by no means justified the
blunder and crime committed by the Dutch farmers, who
put Tamboosa to death, and would not even listen to his
prayer for mercy on behalf of his young attendant, who
suffered with him. Scarcely was this execution over when
the armies of Dingaan and Panda met in battle. In this
fierce encounter two regiments were entirely destroyed, and
the fortune of the day declared in favour of Panda, merely
in consequence of a portion of his brother's army deserting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
in his favour. The Dutch farmers vigorously followed up
this success, and forced Dingaan to take shelter among a
small tribe close to Delagoa Bay, who killed him in order
to secure the favour of his conquerors.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Panda proclaimed king.</i></div>

<p>On the 14th of February, 1840, and on the banks of the
Umvolosi river, the emigrant Boers proclaimed Panda
king of the Zulu people, and at the same time declared that
their own sovereignty extended from St. Lucia Bay to the
Umzimvoboo (St. John's). Shortly previous to this date,
Sir George Napier had ordered the British garrison to
abandon D'Urban, and Captain Jervis, who held the local
command, said, on the occasion of his departure, that he
wished the inhabitants peace and happiness, hoping that
they would cultivate these beautiful regions in quiet and
prosperity, "ever regardful of the rights of the people
whose country you have adopted, and whose home you
have made your own." We cannot be surprised that, under
all the circumstances, the emigrant Boers looked upon
Natal as rightfully their country, and that the British
Government had even abandoned it in their favour. Having
assisted in conquering Dingaan, and placed Panda upon
the throne, there was no reason to fear native aggressions.
No fewer than 36,000 head of cattle were given in by the
new monarch as an indemnity, so that the Boers were
able to settle down not only in peace, but with considerable
additional means at their disposal.</p>

<p>The government adopted by this society of farmers
was of an exceedingly ill-concerted character, and soon
proved to be essentially anarchic and unworkable. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
legislative, executive, and judicial powers were centred
in a Volksraad of twenty-four members, who were required
to assemble every three months at Pietermaritzburg. All
the members performed their duties gratuitously, but
landrosts, each of whom enjoyed a salary of £100 per
annum, were appointed at the chief town, as well as
at D'Urban and Weenen. Two or three members of
the Volksraad, who happened to live near Pietermaritzburg,
formed what was styled the Commissie Raad, to
whom executive functions requiring immediate despatch
were entrusted; but whatever they did had to be submitted
for approval to the entire Volksraad. Besides,
a federal bond of union existed with the Winburg, Caledon,
and Madder districts of the Orange Free State, from which
places delegates were sent. The acts of the Commissie
Raad, as well as those of the permanent officials, were so
assailed in the Volksraad, and such personal and offensive
attacks were indulged in by this body, that good government
became impossible; and so little was law respected,
that Judge Cloete informs us that when he arrived as
Commissioner in 1843, the landrost of Pietermaritzburg
informed him that a judgment which he had passed several
months before, against a respectable inhabitant living only
a few miles from that town, ordering him to return cattle
which he had illegally withheld from a Hottentot, was still
a dead letter, as the defendant had openly declared he
would shoot the first messenger of the law who should
dare to come on his premises.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The English and the Boers.</i></div>

<p>The Volksraad of the Boers had applied to the Governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of the Cape Colony for acknowledgment and recognition
of the State as free and independent, and Sir George Napier
had returned an answer by no means unfavourable, but
their conduct soon made it evident that it would be impossible
to grant their petition. Stock was stolen from
Natal farmers towards the end of the year 1840, and armed
burghers, under Andries Pretorius, were instructed to pursue
the thieves. Traces of cattle, supposed to be those stolen,
were followed to some kraals of the Amabaka tribe, and
without any delay these people were attacked, several
killed, 3000 head of cattle and 250 sheep and goats carried
off. At the same time seventeen children were seized&mdash;in
fact, captured as slaves. The conduct of Pretorius was
approved by the Volksraad, but Sir George Napier found
himself obliged to reprobate it in the strongest language.
British troops were immediately sent to the Umgasi river,
between the Kei and the Umzimvoboo, and his Excellency
declined any further intercourse with the emigrant Boers,
unless they distinctly acknowledged that they were subjects
of the Queen of England. Although the Home Government
was at that time very reluctant to extend its colonial
possessions, a despatch was sent to Sir George Napier, in
which he was informed that her Majesty could not acknowledge
the independence of her own subjects, but that the
trade of the emigrant Boers would be placed upon the same
footing as that of any other British settlement, upon their
receiving a military force to exclude the interference with
the country by any other European power. It was then
within the option of the Boers to secure all the substantial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
advantages of self government; but as in the Transvaal
now, so in Natal at the period in question&mdash;obstinate folly
animated the councils of the people, and an ultimatum was
sent, stating their intention "to remain on the same footing
as heretofore." Upon this, Sir George Napier issued
a proclamation, in which it was stated that as the emigrant
farmers had refused to be recognised or treated as British
subjects, and had recently passed a resolution by which all
Kafirs inhabiting Natal were to be removed, without their
consent, into the country of Faku (Pondoland), military
occupation of the colony would be resumed. Shortly
afterwards, the troops stationed at the Umgazi camp were
ordered to march to Natal. This small force, consisting of
250 men, besides a small party of the Cape corps and two
field-pieces, arrived safely at D'Urban, and a few days
afterwards the brig <i>Pilot</i> came to anchor in the bay, bringing
them stores and provisions, as well as two 18-pounders
and ammunition. This vessel was soon afterwards followed
by the schooner <i>Mazeppa</i>.</p>

<p>The Volksraad of the emigrant Boers was astonished
and indignant at the military occupation of D'Urban, and
more than 300 men, under Andries Pretorius, were immediately
ordered out. The capture of some cattle, and
the receipt of a letter ordering him to quit Natal, so enraged
the commander of the small English force, that
he led a night attack against the Dutch camp at Congella.
So ill managed, however, was the expedition, that Captain
Smith was repulsed and his guns captured. Out of 140 men
whom he led in this unfortunate affray no fewer than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
103 were killed, wounded, and missing. He then saw that
his little force was reduced to extremities, but exerted himself
most indefatigably and perseveringly to resist to the
last. A fortification something similar in character to a
laager was formed at D'Urban, by means of the numerous
waggons in the camp, with the requisite trenches and mounds.
The Dutch Boers fortunately allowed the time in which
they should have taken advantage of their victory to pass
by, and soon saw that, in consequence of their inertness,
a conquest which in the first instance would have been easy
was now converted into a siege. In the mean time Captain
Smith was able to send off for assistance to the Cape Colony.
Richard King, then living in a hut at D'Urban, volunteered
to carry the despatches. Mr. G. C. Cato conveyed him and
his horses across the channel to the Bluff, and then he
rode off, leading a spare horse, and before daybreak
succeeded in passing the Umcomas river. There he was
safe from the danger of pursuit, but had to face the perils
of crossing two hundred rivers, and of traversing a wild
country inhabited by savages. Upon this slender thread
hung the destinies of the British in Natal.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The English besieged.</i></div>

<p>Encouraged by their success, the Boers overpowered
the detachment of British troops stationed at the Point,
and took most of the English residents prisoners to Pietermaritzburg.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Then all their efforts were directed against
the fort, in which Captain Smith had been able to mount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
an 18-pounder and to secure provisions and ammunition.
The farmers, who had three field-pieces, carried on a heavy
cannonade for three days, and when they had exhausted
their ammunition, turned the siege into a rigorous blockade.
Two sorties made by the garrison were unavailing, and at
last the rations were reduced to the smallest quantity sufficient
to sustain life; dried horseflesh became the principal
article of food, and the utmost anxiety prevailed as to the
success of Richard King, and the arrival of reinforcements
from the Cape Colony. Many a time eyes were strained
for some sign of assistance; at last, on the night of the
24th of June, they saw, with inexpressible relief, the rockets
and blue lights which announced that a vessel with reinforcements
had arrived.</p>

<p>Dick King had succeeded. After a ride of many
hundreds of miles over trackless, unknown, and savage
regions, he had safely reached the Cape Colony. It was
on the ninth day after he left the Bluff at Natal that he
arrived, almost exhausted, in Graham's Town. Colonel
Hare, the Lieutenant-Governor of the Eastern Province,
immediately sent the grenadier company of the 27th Regiment,
in the schooner <i>Conch</i>, from Port Elizabeth, and
when Sir George Napier heard the news in Cape Town,
he lost no time in persuading Admiral Percy to despatch
the flagship <i>Southampton</i>, with the 25th Regiment on board,
under the command of Colonel Cloete. The ship of war
arrived at Natal only one day after the <i>Conch</i>. A landing
was immediately effected with very trifling loss; the Boer
force was driven back to the Congella. A gale of wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
drove the Southampton to sea, and supplies became so
scarce that Colonel Cloete was obliged to obtain the services
of Zulus to secure cattle. Some of these killed two Dutch
farmers, and this gave occasion to a panic among the
Boers, who precipitately fled to Pietermaritzburg.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Dismay of the Boers.</i></div>

<p>Amidst great consternation and great confusion, a
meeting of the Volksraad was held in the church at Pietermaritzburg,
when recriminations, quarrelling, and loud
talking occupied the entire Sunday. At last it was resolved
to propose terms of peace to Colonel Cloete; but the
ignorance and simplicity of the Boers were displayed by
their holding out as a threat the succour they might receive
from the King of Holland, to whom letters had some time
previously been sent by the hands of a trader named
Smellekamp. After negotiations, Colonel Cloete granted
an amnesty to all except four ringleaders, and Natal was
peaceably once more under the rule of the British Crown.
These transactions took place in 1842; and in the following
year the Honourable Henry Cloete, afterwards a Judge
of the Supreme Court of the Cape Colony, was sent to Natal
as her Majesty's Commissioner, with ample authority to
inaugurate a settled system of government, and to put an
end to the anarchy and confusion which prevailed. By
the exercise of great tact and judgment he was successful.
A powerful radical faction in the Volksraad opposed submission
in the most outrageous and foolish manner. They
even adopted a plan to assassinate the leading members of
the peace party; but Andries Pretorius, one of the latter,
and a wise, true friend of his adopted country, having discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the plot, exposed it publicly, and brought its
authors to shame. Judge Cloete tells us that this patriot
addressed the meeting in a strain of impassioned extemporaneous
eloquence not unworthy of Cicero when denouncing
Cataline, and turned the tide so powerfully
against the would-be assassins as to entirely defeat their
plot. Entire submission to the British Government
followed. Major Smith was succeeded by Colonel Boys, of
the 45th Regiment, as military commandant, and his
Honour Martin West, resident magistrate of Graham's
Town, was appointed the first Lieutenant-Governor of
Natal.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">NATIVE POLICY IN NATAL. LAWS, CUSTOMS, AND
RELIGION OF THE ZULUS.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The protection of the natives was the professed object of
the British Government in taking possession of Natal. The
conquests of Chaka had driven no fewer than 100,000
fugitives to the westward of the Tugela river, and how to
rule this vast and fast increasing number of natives soon
became a problem fraught both with difficulty and danger.
Mr. Theophilus Shepstone, son of a Wesleyan missionary,
thoroughly conversant with the Kafir language, customs,
manners, and habits, was appointed to take charge of the
numerous natives of Natal. His policy can be very briefly
described. It was to keep all the coloured races entirely
distinct from the white population. They were collected
in locations, and governed by their own laws, through
their own chiefs, under Mr. Shepstone as the great chief.
Large tracts of country, rugged and mountainous, were set
apart for the various tribes, and there, in an Italian
climate, and in the lap of a most productive and generous
soil, they increased and multiplied. Christianity and real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
civilization were ignored, and a most dangerous <i>imperium in
imperio</i> created. The wretched refugees who fled from the
Zulu tyrant found their lot in Natal incomparably more
happy than in the precarious existence of former days.
Their easy, savage, sensuous life made them useless
citizens, and when labour was required for the sugar
plantations on the coast, it had to be obtained from India.
However smoothly and well the native policy seemed to
work, it soon became very evident that the 20,000 white
people of Natal were really seated on a political volcano.
Three hundred thousand heathen savages of an alien race
had the power to rise and destroy them at any moment,
and it was impossible to be sure that they might not at any
time have the inclination. All the checks which religion
and civilization place on men had been deliberately cast
aside. No doubt the Zulu monarch was feared; but there
can be no doubt also that if the dread paramount ruler of
the Zulu race had at any time crossed the Tugela as a
conqueror, tens of thousands of his own race in the colony
would have joined him out of fear, and hastened to prove
their loyalty by the massacre of every white inhabitant of
Natal. This is no fanciful idea, but sober earnest fact.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Shepstone native policy.</i></div>

<p>There was no difficulty at first in subjecting to proper
control the broken, dispirited bands of refugees, who sought
shelter, food, and protection in Natal; and if right methods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
had been adopted, one of the finest races of the African
continent would have been raised from a state of loathsome
degradation to one of civilization&mdash;saved from heathenism
themselves to become coadjutors with the white races in
raising the country to real prosperity. In place of this,
the cruel slavery of polygamy was permitted, which allows
the men to live in independent idleness by means of the
severe drudgery of their oppressed wives. Grossly impure
and inhuman laws and practices, including the vile superstitions
of witchcraft, were tolerated and allowed. No
country could advance under such circumstances, and the
colony of Natal, therefore, remains at the present day what
it has always been&mdash;immeasurably behind the Cape of
Good Hope; a land of samples in which nothing really
succeeds, and where sugar, which forms its principal
export, is even now a doubtful experiment, on which labour
imported from India at enormous cost has to be employed;
a lovely country, whose fertility is almost as great as its
beauty, but cursed by a most unchristian, wicked, and
foolish system of government, so far as the great bulk of
the population is concerned. It would have been very easy
at the outset to establish comparatively small locations,
presided over by British magistrates, who would have
administered justice according to British law. If, in addition,
title-deeds had been given in such a manner as to
give individual rights, then, in the words of the Rev. W. C.
Holden,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> the large number of natives within the colony
might have been converted into men who would take a real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
interest in the country and soil, for the defence of which
they would fight and die. They would have become a strong
wall of defence against the Zulu on the east, and the
Amaxosa on the west, instead of a source of continual
danger and alarm.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Slavery was abolished everywhere
throughout the British dominions, with the one exception
of Natal. There 50,000 women were sold for wives
to the highest bidder, as horses, cattle, and goods at an
auction mart, under the special sanction and special
arrangement of the Queen's Government.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further, it is necessary to pass briefly
in review the laws, manners, and customs of the Zulu race.
Without a knowledge of this subject it will be perfectly
impossible to appreciate the policy of Sir Bartle Frere, or
to understand either the real causes of the war, or of many
events in its progress. We have seen that Chaka, the Zulu
conqueror, formed a great military nation. His successors
were specially warriors, and as the people chose similar
weapons to those with which the ancient Romans conquered
the world, so, like that people, were they fully animated with
the feeling that <i>virtus</i>, or the highest possible merit, consisted
in bravery in the field of battle. The Boers despised
the enemy, and hundreds of their bravest men fell victims.
Almost about the same time, the English settlers at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
D'Urban made the same mistake, and 2000 of their Kafir
allies, as well as several of their own number, were slaughtered
and left to be devoured by beasts of prey on the
hills of Zululand. History repeats itself: Lord Chelmsford
made the same mistake, which was expiated in the blood
of hundreds of British soldiers on the field of Isandhlwana.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Zulu customs.</i></div>

<p>Among the Zulus every female child is so much property,
and in this respect treated exactly like a chattel or
beast of burden. Her life is one of the grossest degradation
and slavery. When she has reached the age of puberty
disgusting ceremonies are performed, and there is no idea
or appreciation of chastity. The most brutal lust is not
only tolerated, but actually enforced by law. When a girl
is married, she is merely sold to the highest bidder, entirely
without reference to her own consent, and then becomes
the slave of her husband, for whom she has to labour in the
field and perform menial work. The day after the party of
a bride has arrived at her owner's hut, the peculiar ceremony
takes place of the woman being allowed and enjoined
to tax her powers to the utmost to use abusive language to
her lord. She pours every insulting and provoking epithet
she can think of upon him, this being the last time in
which she is permitted to act and speak independently.
At last she takes a certain feather out of her head, by
means of which the act of marriage, or rather of going into
slavery, becomes complete. Mr. Holden speaks of the great
obscenity at "marriage" celebrations, and remarks that
"no respectable pages can be defiled with a description of
what then takes place, especially in connection with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
marriage of men of rank and chiefs. There is full licence
given to wholesale debauchery, and both men and women
glory in their shame."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It is impossible to pursue this
subject further. This is certain, that the very grossest and
most filthy obscenities and immoralities are absolutely enjoined
and required by Zulu law and custom. Marriage
is entirely a misnomer. To quote from an excellent authority,
"No word corresponding to the Saxon word 'wife'
is found in the Zulu language. The term most nearly
approaching to it is <i>umkake</i>, and its correlatives <i>umkako</i> and
<i>umkami</i>, which means his <i>she</i> or <i>female</i>. The man owns his
wives as truly, according to native law, as he does his spear
or his goat, and he speaks of them accordingly." The owner
of the woman says, "I have paid so many cattle for you;
therefore you are <i>my slave</i>, my dog, and your proper place
is under my feet." One of these poor slaves, when seen
standing by a load far too great for her strength, was asked
if she could carry it. She stood up and ingenuously remarked,
"If I were a man I could not, but I am a woman."
There is no slavery in the world more sad or deplorable
than that to which the poor women of the Zulu nation are
subjected.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Religion of the Zulus.</i></div>

<p>Spiritualism is the religion of the Zulu, and witchcraft
is the machinery by means of which it is practised. Only
a very vague idea exists about a Supreme Being, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
definite national faith embraces only a belief in the influence
of the spirits of deceased ancestors. The ghosts
of departed chiefs and warriors are specially respected and
feared. It is to these spirits that they attribute all the
power given by Christians to God, and the witch-doctors
are the mediums or priests of the worship. A knowledge
of subtle and powerful vegetable poisons exists, and so
common is the practice of secret poisoning that universal
safeguards are used against it. Every one who gives food
to another takes a part himself, in proof that it contains
no poison. Besides deadly drugs, there is what is styled
the "ubuti," or bewitching matter, which is supposed to be
deposited in some secret place, and to be made the instrument
of evil by means of supernatural agency. The
"isanusi," or witch-doctors, are the go-betweens, whose duty
it is to discover and to avert evil. These men fill the
threefold office of doctors, priests, and soothsayers. They
heal diseases, offer sacrifices, and exercise the art of
divination. As they are assumed to have full power over
the invisible world, their influence is enormous, and is
readily taken advantage of by chiefs and powerful men, for
the purpose of destroying enemies and promoting schemes
of war and plunder. A youth who aspires to be enrolled
among the isanusi gives early signs of being destined for
the office. He dreams of the spirits of the departed chiefs
of his people, sees visions, falls into fits of frenzy; he
catches snakes and twists them round his person, seeks
out medicinal roots, and goes for instruction to experienced
isanusi. At last what is called a "change in the moon"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
takes place within him; he becomes a medium fitted to
hold converse with spirits, and is able to communicate
with them. One of the greatest authorities who has ever
lived with and studied the Kafir races&mdash;Mr. Warner&mdash;says,
"It is impossible to suppose that these priests are not,
to a considerable extent, self-deceived, as well as the deceivers
of others; and there is no difficulty, to one who
believes the Bible to be a divine revelation, in supposing
that they are also to a certain extent under Satanic influence;
for the idolatrous and heathen nations of the
earth are declared in the inspired volume to be, in a
peculiar manner, under the influence and power of the
devil."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Witch doctors.</i></div>

<p>Every illness and misfortune is supposed to be caused
by witchcraft. It usually happens that the suspected
person is a rich man, or some one on whom it is thought
desirable to wreak vengeance. The people of the kraal and
neighbourhood go in a body to the isanusi, who, before
their arrival, foretells their approach, and makes other
revelations, frequently so extraordinary that the Rev.
Mr. Holden,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> who is thoroughly conversant with the subject,
states that there is much greater difficulty in explaining
these phenomena by ordinary means than by supernatural
interposition. The whole company, on arrival, sit down
and salute the witch-doctor; they are then told to beat
the ground with their sticks, and while this is in course
of being done, he repeatedly shouts out, "Yeswa!"&mdash;"He
is here!" He discloses secrets about the accused, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
last, fixing his eyes upon the doomed one, charges him
with the crime. Generally the isanusi succeeds in selecting
the suspected person; but if he fail, a circle is formed, and
a wild, frenzied dance performed, amidst most frightful
gesticulations and cries. Among the Zulus, not only is the
unfortunate person killed whom the witch-doctor declares
guilty, but his wife and children are murdered, and his
property seized. Among the Amaxosa Kafirs, the most
frightful tortures are used to induce the unfortunate victim
to confess.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It is difficult to appreciate adequately the
enormous power of the witch-doctors. It was in 1857 that
Umhlakaza was made a willing tool in the hands of Kreli,
Sandilli, and Umhala for the purpose of a war of extermination
against the whites. It was prophesied that if the
people destroyed their cattle and corn, the whole would
rise again with vast increase, and that their enemies
would be utterly destroyed. Sir George Grey had taken
every precaution, and war was therefore made impossible.
Like the witches in "Macbeth," the prophet had merely
lured on his victims to destruction. Having burned their
ships, by destroying all their resources there was no escape,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and, in spite of the humane exertions of the colonists,
70,000 human beings perished of famine in a land of
plenty. It will thus be seen how an entire people can
easily be induced to embark in the most desperate
undertakings by the skilful use of the superstitious
means at the disposal of their chiefs. Sacrifices of
beasts are offered by the priests, according to prescribed
rules. These are made to the spirits of the departed.
A hut is sacredly cleaned and set apart, in which the
sacrifice is shut up during the night, in order that
the "isituta," or spirits, may drink in its flavour. On
the next day the place is opened, and the meat devoured
by the people. All sacrifices, with trifling exceptions, must
be offered by priests. The blood is never spilt, but caught
in a vessel, and it is necessary to burn the bones. The
frenzy or inspired madness characteristic of the priests
of the ancient oracles is commonly assumed by the priests
of the Zulu spiritualists, and many of their ceremonies are
occult, and have never been made known to Europeans.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Great military rite.</i></div>

<p>The Zulu government is thoroughly despotic. The will
of the tyrant is law, and he has unlimited power of life or
death. We have seen that Chaka sacrificed everything to
military power, and in order to succeed, banished even
circumcision, and refused to allow his warriors to marry.
Women's love and children's tenderness were forbidden to
the stern soldiers of the new empire. Medicines composed
of various plants and roots were used to purify the body and
make it strong, and ordinarily sacrifices were offered for
the same purpose. The great national sacrifice to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the army invulnerable is styled "ukukufula," when flesh
is cut off the shoulder of a living beast and roasted on
a fire into which certain charms have been thrown. Each
man bites off a mouthful, and passes on the meat to the
next, while the priest makes incisions in parts of their bodies,
into which he inserts the powdered charcoal of the charms.
The poor animal is left in torture all this time, and is not
killed until the ceremonies are ended. A decoction is also
prepared from medicinal roots, and sprinkled by means of
the tail of an ox over the bodies of the warriors. All this is
designed to make the Zulus either invulnerable, or to enable
them, if they do fall in battle, to join triumphantly the
heroes of their race in the spirit world. The three great
divisions of the army already referred to, comprising
"men," "young men," and "carriers," were sub-divided
into regiments with a proper staff of officers. The Zulu
strength is in attack, when with ferocious yells they
throw themselves with undaunted bravery upon their
enemy. Two horns advance and endeavour to flank the
foe, while the main body follows quickly to their support.
<i>Virtus</i>&mdash;military bravery&mdash;is their <i>summum bonum</i>, and
death is the immediate penalty of any form of cowardice.
Extreme cunning and dissimulation are considered essential
qualifications of a general, so that to lure a foe into ambush,
or to deceive him by illusory promises or messages
of peace, are considered proofs of wisdom and ability.
Honour, humanity, and generosity are perfectly unknown,
and merely considered signs of weakness. When an enemy
is defeated, prisoners are never taken, and those not killed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
in the heat of battle are cruelly tortured and mutilated,
with every mark of indignity and contempt. Women and
children are not spared, and the most cruel destruction of
the most cruel northern barbarians, who devastated Europe,
pales before the complete and effectual ruin which marks
the progress of a Zulu conqueror.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Sir Bartle Frere.</i></div>

<p>In times of peace the army remains at military kraals,
and is occasionally called up to the great place of the king
for review. It is always in a state of readiness, and burning
for employment. War is the pastime, glory, and wish
of the men, who eagerly desire to wash their spears in
blood, that they may obtain the only glory for which they
care to live, and secure that plunder which can enable
them to acquire wives and cattle. Nothing could be more
dangerous, or a more awful threat to a colony, than an
army of this description under the orders of a despotic
savage, without the slightest principle, and urged on to
fight by all the traditions and ideas of his race. Let it be
remembered also that the country of Natal was once owned
by the Zulus, and that, while held by a garrison of only
20,000 whites, there were no fewer than 300,000 savage
heathen inhabitants in it of similar colour, race, and religion
to the people of Cetywayo. Once let the flood-gates
be lifted and a conquering "invulnerable" army enter
Natal, nothing could prevent the general rising of the vast
masses of natives within that colony. If that had occurred,
British dominion would have set in an ocean of blood, and
every white man, woman, and child in the settlement must
have been slaughtered. It was one wise, good man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
averted that catastrophe, and his name was Bartle Frere.
Slowly, but most certainly, will the mists of prejudice be
lifted from the minds of the English people, and they will
learn to know that the policy they so much vilified saved
the British name from dishonour, and the British people
and British interests in South Africa from destruction.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">EVENTS PRELIMINARY TO ZULU WAR&mdash;COMMENCEMENT
OF HOSTILITIES.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Transvaal in danger.</i></div>

<p class="pn p2">Thirty-six years had elapsed since the eventful ride of
Dick King from D'Urban to Graham's Town. The British
colony of Natal had grown slowly. Immigrants arrived;
a representative Constitution was granted. During this
period numbers of people of Dutch extraction formed settlements
in the Orange Free State and Transvaal Republic.
The British Government in the first instance established
sovereignty over the former country, but abandoned it on
the 23rd of February, 1854. The Republic commenced from
that date. So far as the Transvaal is concerned, Potgieter
established the town of Potchefstroom in 1839, and soon after
enormous territory, extending from the Vaal to the Limpopo,
came under the dominion of the South African Republic.
The first session of Volksraad was held in 1848, and it was
in 1852 that Pretorius succeeded in obtaining the treaty
at Sand river, by means of which the independence of
the Republic was recognized by the British Crown. One
of the first Acts of the Volksraad was to repeal a former
resolution fixing their southern boundary at the twentyfifth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
degree of south latitude, because the Volksraad has
no means of determining where the said degree of south
latitude is. Amongst the people civilization made slow
progress. "Not many years ago," wrote Mr. Thomas
Baines in his valuable work on the Gold Regions of South
Africa, "their own Surveyor-General was mobbed for using
a theodolite in the streets of Potchefstroom instead of
stepping off the distance like the Veldt Valkt miester of
the good old times." Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in his
recent narrative, gives us yet more amusing and striking
illustrations of the utter simplicity and ignorance of the
Boers. As was to be expected under the circumstances,
the Government was extremely narrow and objectionable;
in proof of which it is only necessary to state that no
Englishman or German was allowed to possess landed
property, it was forbidden to discover or work minerals,
while slavery really existed, and was practised under what
was styled the Apprentice Law, passed in 1856.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> In spite
of the discovery of gold-fields at Pilgrim's Rest, the country
became insolvent, wars with the natives took place, and
at last such a state of insolvency and danger was attained
that the British Government found it imperatively necessary
to intervene. The Zulus, under Cetywayo, intended
to overrun the country, and this would have threatened
all British South Africa. The northern territory of the
State had already been abandoned to the natives; the
Government was powerless, and all confidence in it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
fled; commerce was destroyed, and the country was bankrupt.
Under these circumstances, Sir Theophilus Shepstone,
on the 12th of April, 1877, found himself imperatively
obliged to place the Transvaal territory under the protection
of the British flag.</p>

<p>In Natal, under the administration of Sir Benjamin
Pine, during the year 1873, a rebellion broke out on the
part of a chief named Langalibalele, which was only prevented
from becoming a general war by the admirably
prompt action of the local Government. The philanthropic
societies in England, with Bishop Colenso, championed the
cause of this rebel, and Sir B. Pine was, in consequence
of their exertions, recalled. Sir Garnet Wolseley, who
succeeded that officer, says, "Langalibalele, as I am informed
by all classes here, official and non-official (a small
knot of men of extreme views excepted), is regarded by the
native population at large as a chief who, having defied
the authorities, and in doing so occasioned the murder
of two white men, is now suffering for that conduct. In
their opinion his attempts to brave the Government have
been checkmated, and his banishment from the colony,
regarded as a lenient punishment by the natives at large,
cannot fail to be a serious warning to all other Kafir chiefs,
not only in Natal but in the whole of South Africa, to
avoid imitating his example."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Sir Garnet Wolseley effected an important change in
the colonial legislature, by adding eight nominee members
to the Council, which previously consisted of five <i>ex-officio</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and fifteen elected members. The annexation of the Transvaal
followed; and, speaking of this, Sir Benjamin Pine
says that "the strong ground taken in defence of the
measure is that its hostilities with the native tribes seriously
imperilled the peace of our colonies&mdash;that it was, in fact,
a next-door neighbour's house in flames, which might any
moment set ours on fire. In this respect, the ground for
annexing the Transvaal Republic was very much stronger
than that which justified our taking possession of Natal.
The latter country did not at that time touch our boundary
at any point. It was a house several streets off."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Diamonds and guns.</i></div>

<p>The discovery of diamonds in South Africa, in 1867,
exercised by degrees an enormous influence upon the
attitude of the natives throughout Southern Africa. When
the success of the dry diggings at the New Rush caused the
formation of Kimberley, that town became the centre of
an enormous gun trade. From north and east, thousands of
Kafirs of various tribes flocked to a place where they could
obtain, for the reward of their labour, the means of exterminating
the hated white man in South Africa. The
Gealekas under Kreli, the Gaikas of Sandilli, as well as
the Zulus beyond Natal, were not slow to seize such an
opportunity. For years the trade continued, and the
weapons purchased were soon used against the Government
which permitted their sale. Wars were waged upon the
eastern and northern borders of the Cape Colony during
1877, 1878, and 1879. Sir Benjamin Pine, with some
fancy and a great deal of truth, styles the diamond of the
Kimberley mines the bloodstone of South Africa. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the Zulu system makes war a necessity constantly thirsted
for by the army, advantage was taken of the easy opportunity
of getting firearms afforded by the inconceivable
blindness and fatuity of the British Government. In the
year 1877, Cetywayo had quite made up his mind for a
deadly conflict with the white man. Guns were purchased,
preparations were made, and the army crouched like a
tiger in its lair, ready to spring.</p>

<p>Since the first establishment of the colony of Natal,
and of the Transvaal Republic, the Governments of these
countries had the Zulu military power suspended, like the
sword of Damocles, as a perpetual threat over their heads.
Of course, by the annexation of the latter State in 1877, all
its responsibilities devolved upon her Majesty's Government.
Cetywayo, the son of Panda, succeeded his father in the
year 1872, and it formed part of Sir T. Shepstone's policy
to conciliate and please him in every possible manner.
That officer went so far as to attend his coronation, which
was celebrated with the grandest forms of savage ceremonial.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
At the same time a number of promises and
engagements were received from the king. All this was,
of course, merely a solemn farce. The descendant of
Dingaan, who first signed a deed giving Natal to the Dutch,
and then murdered in cold blood the men who had trusted
to his honour, was not likely to depart from the traditions
and policy of his race. Dissimulation, fraud, and cunning
are characteristic qualities of every Zulu ruler, and Cetywayo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
excelled in them all. The Government of Natal was
lulled into security, while Bishop Colenso and the well-meaning
but profoundly ignorant men who form the self-styled
philanthropical societies in England have, even up
to the present moment, been completely hoodwinked and
deceived. Sir Bartle Frere, writing of Cetywayo's solemn
promises, says, "None of these promises have been since
fulfilled; the cruelties and barbarisms which deformed the
internal administration of Zululand in Panda's reign have
been aggravated during the reign of Cetywayo, and his
relations with his neighbours have been conducted in a
spirit fatal to peace and security beyond the Zulu border."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Natal in danger.</i></div>

<p>The well-organized and peculiarly formidable military
power of the Zulus was still further consolidated and
strengthened by Cetywayo, so that a standing menace and
threat of a very serious nature existed against both Natal
and the Transvaal. Nothing can better prove the danger
than the fact that the Zulu monarch formally and repeatedly
requested the consent of the British Government
to wars of aggression, which he proposed for the ostensible
purpose of initiating his young soldiers in bloodshed, and
reviving the system of unprovoked territorial aggression
which had been so successfully carried out by the model
and demi-god of the nation&mdash;Chaka.</p>

<p>A large tract of land on the western boundary of Zululand,
between the Buffalo and Pongolo rivers, which had
long formed part of the Transvaal, was claimed by the
Zulus, and they had requested the Natal Government to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
arbitrate in this matter. Eventually a Commission was
appointed, which decided that Cetywayo's cession of a tract
of land relied on by the Transvaal claim was promised
when he was only heir apparent, and that the cession had
not been subsequently formally ratified by his father Panda,
nor by the great council of the Zulu nation; therefore the
country in question had never ceased to belong to them.
Private rights of <i>bonâ fide</i> settlers, which could not in justice
be abrogated, were confirmed, but otherwise the sovereignty
of the territory was ceded to the Zulus. Since his installation
the tone of Cetywayo had become entirely altered.
When a remonstrance was sent against a barbarous murder
of young women by the king, replies of extreme insolence
were sent to the Natal Government, and the opportunity
was taken to state that no responsibility was admitted;
at the same time, the solemn installation promises were
distinctly denied, and Cetywayo affirmed his intention of
shedding blood in future on a much greater scale. In
the latter part of July, 1878, the Zulu chief Sirayo entered
British territory, carried off two women&mdash;British subjects&mdash;and
forcibly put them to death. Redress was demanded,
but not given.</p>

<p>On the 11th of December, 1878, a final message was
sent to Cetywayo, in which the reasonable and just demands
of the Government were summarized. He was called upon
to give up the offenders who had violated British territory,
and to effect various reforms in the administration of his
government, in accordance with the solemn promises made
at his installation. A few informal messages made and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
retracted only served to show the cunning and deceit of
Cetywayo, and it was clear to demonstration that the Zulu
potentate and the Zulu army had determined upon war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hostile attitude of the Zulus.</i></div>

<p>The High Commissioner writes (30th September) to
the Imperial Government:&mdash;"It is difficult to give any
adequate idea of the strength of evidence of the state of
feeling. Zulu regiments are reported as moving about on
unusual and special errands, several of them organizing
royal hunts on a great scale in parts of the country where
little game is to be expected, and where the obvious object
is to guard the border against attack. The hunters are said
to have received orders to follow any game they may rouse
across the border, which it appears is, according to Zulu
custom, a recognized mode of provoking or declaring war.
Unusual bodies of armed men are stated to watch all drifts
and roads leading into Zululand, and these guards are
occasionally reported as warning off Natal natives from
entering the Zulu territory, accompanying the warning
with contemptuous intimation that orders have been given
to kill all Natalions if they trespass across the border.
Zulu subjects came hastily into Natal to reclaim cattle
which they had sent hither to graze, giving as their reason
that Zululand is so disturbed that they know not what will
happen. Serious alarm is expressed because three large
ships have been seen on the coast making for Delagoa Bay,
and great irritation is expressed by Zulus at the stoppage
of the supplies of arms and ammunition they used to
receive through that port.</p>

<p>"The reports first received of raids into Natal territory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
by large bodies of armed men, who dragged two refugee
women out of the huts of British subjects, with expressions
of contemptuous disregard for what the English Government
might think, or say, or do, and the murders of the
women directly they were on the other side of the boundary
line, appear to be confirmed in every particular.</p>

<p>"There seems to be no doubt that the parties were
headed by two sons of Sirayo. This chief lives near the
Natal border, and was well known as extremely anti-English
in his feelings. Until quite lately he was so little in favour
with Cetywayo, that he had not for some time attended to
any summons to the royal kraal. He was nevertheless
appointed by Cetywayo to represent him at the Boundary
Commission. Partly, it was said, on account of his rank
and influence and known antipathy to Europeans, and
partly because he could not refuse to attend at the royal
kraal to give an account of his stewardship, he did so
attend, and in the absence of the prime minister, was
appointed to act for him, a proceeding which, considering
his known anti-English feeling, is regarded as significant.</p>

<p>"It is to be remembered that the facts, of which a brief
summary is here given, have been sifted from a mass of
very alarming rumours, current during the month, which
his Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor considered more
doubtful, or unworthy of credit, but which are circulated
in a manner to increase agitation and excitement on both
sides of the border."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Firmness of Sir Bartle Frere.</i></div>

<p>The only question remained&mdash;Were we to allow the
enemy to wait for a favourable opportunity and attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
us at an advantage, or protect Natal and British South
Africa by a policy of firmness and consistency? The
latter alternative was chosen by her Majesty's High
Commissioner; and on the 4th of January, 1879, Sir
Bartle Frere placed in the hands of Lieutenant-General
Lord Chelmsford, commanding in South Africa, the further
enforcement of all demands.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> There can be no doubt
whatever that this course was the only possible one consistent
with the safety of Natal and British South Africa.
Cetywayo had been long preparing for war, and had most
fully determined upon it, urged on by the irrepressible
warlike organization and the army, which thirsted for an
opportunity of exertion and could not safely be balked.
Self-preservation and self-defence rendered it absolutely
necessary that an army should enter Zululand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in January, 1879, four columns crossed the
Tugela. The line of advance described a crescent, of
which one horn rested on Luneberg, or the Pongolo, and
the other, or base, terminated at the lower drift of the
Tugela, close to the sea. Colonel Pearson was in command
of the first column, whose centre was an intrenched camp
on the summit of a bluff directly overlooking the Tugela
river.</p>

<p>It consisted of&mdash;</p>

<p>Regular infantry.&mdash;1500, comprising eight companies of
the Buffs under Colonel Parnell, and six companies of the
99th under Colonel Welman.</p>

<p>Royal Engineers.&mdash;One company, with two 7-pounder
guns, under Lieutenant Lloyd.</p>

<p>Naval Brigade.&mdash;200 blue jackets and marines, under
Captain Campbell, from H.M.S. <i>Active</i> and <i>Tenedos</i>, with
three Gatling guns.</p>

<p>Mounted infantry.&mdash;200 of Captain Barrow's.</p>

<p>Mounted volunteers.&mdash;200 belonging to the D'Urban
Mounted Rifles (Captain W. Shepstone); Alexander
Mounted Rifles (Captain Arbuthnot); Victoria Mounted
Rifles (Captain Sauer); Stanger Mounted Rifles (Captain
Addison); the Natal Hussars (Captain Norton). To all this
must be added a native contingent of 2000, under Major
Graves, and two companies of the 99th, posted at Stanger
and D'Urban. This was the coast column.</p>

<p>The second column was planted at a commanding
position called Krantz Kop, inaccessible except on the
Natal side. It comprised 3300 natives, with 200 European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
officers, supported by two rocket tubes under Lieutenant
Russell, R.E., and 250 mounted natives.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lord Chelmsford's advance.</i></div>

<p>The head-quarters of the third column was at Helpmakaar,
situated on high and open ground commanding
an extensive prospect. The depôts were at Grey Town and
Ladysmith. This column was exceptionally strong, and consisted
of seven companies of the 1-24th, and eight of the
2-24th; six 7-pounder guns with special Kaffrarian carriages;
a squadron of mounted infantry under Captain
Browne; the Natal Mounted Police, 150 strong; the Natal
Carbineers (Captain Shepstone); the Buffalo Border Guard
(Captain Robson); the Newcastle Mounted Rifles (Captain
Bradstreet); 2000 of the Native Contingent, 2nd Regiment,
under Commandant Lonsdale, and 2000 natives under
Colonel Glyn. General Lord Chelmsford, commander-in-chief,
accompanied the column.</p>

<p>The fourth column had Utrecht as its base, and rested
its line on the Blood river, thus covering the disputed
Transvaal border. It comprised the 13th and 90th Regiments,
six guns, Buller's Light Horse, and a number of
natives. It consisted of about 2000 well-seasoned, reliable
men, exclusive of the natives, and was under the command
of Colonel Evelyn Wood, V.C.</p>

<p>On the 10th of January, 1879, the full period expired
for the Zulu king to meet the demands of her Majesty's
High Commissioner. On the 11th of January No. 3
column, under Colonel Glyn, crossed the Buffalo river
into Zululand. Heavy rains had made the roads very bad,
and caused the Tugela to rise so much that a barrel-raft, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
pont, and a boat had to be made use of for the passage of
the troops. No opposition whatever was made by the
enemy. In the mean time the fourth column, under
Colonel Wood, had been halted at Bemba's Kop, distant
about thirty-five miles from Rorke's Drift.</p>

<p>On the 11th of January, Lord Chelmsford, with the bulk
of the mounted men of No. 3 column, met Colonel Wood
with his "irregulars" about twenty miles from Rorke's
Drift, and was completely satisfied with the efficiency of the
latter force, and attributed the satisfactory state of Wood's
column to its commander's energy and military knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Burning of Sirayo's kraal.</i></div>

<p>On the 12th of January, Lord Chelmsford wrote: "We
have had our first fight to-day. I ordered the whole force
out this morning to reconnoitre the road along which we
shall eventually have to pass. In passing by the Nkudu
hill, we noticed that some herds of cattle had been driven
up close under the krantz where one of Sirayo's strongholds
was said to be. I ordered Colonel Glyn, with four
companies 1-24th, and the 1-3rd Native Contingent, to
work up under the krantz in skirmishing order. On the
approach of this force near the krantz, fire was opened
upon them out of the caves, and the fight commenced. It
lasted about half an hour, and ended in our obtaining
possession of all the caves and all the cattle. Colonel
Degacher, who had been sent for from camp when we found
that the krantz was occupied by the enemy, came up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
towards the end of the affair with half-battalion 2-24th,
and about 400 of the 2-3rd Native Contingent. This force
went forward to Sirayo's own kraal, which is situated under
a very steep krantz filled with caves. The British soldiers
and natives skirmished, or rather clambered, up the steep
mountain-side, and entered all the caves, which were found
empty. I ordered Sirayo's kraal to be burned, but none
of the other huts were touched. The Native Contingent
behaved very well, and not a native touched a woman or
child, or killed the wounded men."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Subsequently Colonel
Russell, with a small detached force, was attacked by sixty
of the enemy, but his men dismounted and succeeded in
killing nine or ten, among whom was one of Sirayo's sons.
This action was, in fact, the storming of the stronghold of
one of Cetewayo's principal chiefs, and was accompanied
by the capture of 500 cattle. Lord Chelmsford says of this
engagement, "I have visited two wounded Zulus who were
in our hospital, and have seen that they are well looked
after. Directly they are well enough I shall let them go,
so that they may tell their friends how the British make
war."</p>



<p>Both previous to the successful and unresisted crossing
of the Tugela, as well as subsequently, frequent rains had
caused great discomfort to the troops, as well as immensely
increased the difficulties of transport. The <i>impedimenta</i> of
the large force in the field was exceedingly great, and the
want of knowledge of the character of the roads, or tracks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and the capacity of oxen to do the work, resulted in many
delays and difficulties. Large masses of infantry were
moved into the enemy's country, whose entire dependence
for supplies was placed upon heavy waggons drawn by
numerous oxen. No system of carriers was established,
and, with the exception of the fourth (Wood's) column, the
movement of the troops was necessarily exceedingly slow.
On the march each column was exposed to be attacked at a
disadvantage, so enormous was the train of waggons which
had to be guarded, and the knowledge of these facts
evidently enabled the Zulus to perceive the best opportunity
of striking a fatal blow. At a very early stage in the war,
Lord Chelmsford saw the difficulties connected with the
mode of supplies adopted, as he writes on the 16th of
January, "It would be impossible to keep a long line of
road passable for a convoy of waggons, and were we to
advance far into the country it would be almost certain
that, instead of our supplies coming to us, we should have
to return for our supplies."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Zulu tactics.</i></div>

<p>The country into which the British troops had entered
was one in which the mountain-sides are furrowed by deep
kloofs or ravines, generally covered by luxuriant vegetation.
The euphorbia, the cactus, the aloe, and mimosa grow in
profusion, and the bush in many places forms a natural
fortress, in which savages can easily lie in wait to surprise
an enemy. It was in such native fastnesses that the Kafirs
of the Cape Colony loved to wait&mdash;panther-like&mdash;either in
war to attack the white man, or in peace to rob his flocks
and herds. The Zulus, however, fortunately adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
tactics of a different character. Their plan was to attack
in the open field, and, by means of bravery and overwhelming
numbers, to entirely crush the enemy. It was
thus that Chaka had conquered, and it was upon the same
system that Cetywayo relied.</p>

IN THE COLONY&mdash;REQUEST FOR REINFORCEMENTS&mdash;REPLY
FROM THE QUEEN&mdash;THE MINISTRY&mdash;SIR
BARTLE FRERE&mdash;LORD CHELMSFORD.</p>


<p class="pn p2">It is desirable for the sake of justice that the plans of Lord
Chelmsford in commencing the campaign should be given
in his own words. They are contained in a memorandum
dated 16th January, 1879, and are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The reports which I receive from officers commanding
the several columns now operating against Cetywayo show
clearly that at this season of the year a rapid advance into
the heart of Zululand is absolutely impossible.</p>

<p>"The present state of the roads in Natal will be sufficient
to bring home to the mind of every one what
difficulties must stand in the way of those who are endeavouring
to move forward into the enemy's country,
over tracts which have never been traversed, except by a
very few traders' wagons.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lord Chelmsford's plans.</i></div>

<p>"No. 3 column at Rorke's Drift cannot possibly move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
forward even eight miles, until two swamps, into which our
waggons sank up to the body, have been made passable.</p>

<p>"This work will occupy us for at least four days, and
we shall find similar obstacles in front of us, in every march
we are anxious to make.</p>

<p>"Accepting the situation, therefore, it remains for me
to determine what modification of the plan of campaign at
first laid down will be necessary.</p>

<p>"I consider that my original idea of driving, as far as
possible, all the Zulus forward towards the north-east part
of their country, is still thoroughly sound.</p>

<p>"Without, therefore, attempting to push forward faster
than our means will admit of, I propose with Nos. 1, 2, and
3 columns to thoroughly clear or subjugate the country
between the Buffalo and Tugela rivers and the Umhlatoosi
river, by means of expeditions made by those columns from
certain fixed positions.</p>

<p>"No. 1 column will, as already instructed, occupy
Etshowe.</p>

<p>"Instead, however, of crossing the Umhlatoosi river to
Mr. Samuelson's mission station (St. Paul's), it will move
a portion of its force to Entumeni, and occupy that position
as well as Etshowe.</p>

<p>"Having established itself firmly in those two positions,
the main object of this column will be to clear the Inkandhla
bush and forest, or to induce the chiefs and headmen
of the tribes residing or specially stationed in that part of
the country to tender their submission.</p>

<p>"No. 3 column will first advance to a position near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Inkandhla hill, and from there, assisted by a portion of
No. 2 column, will clear the Equideni forest, or induce the
chiefs, etc., to submit.</p>

<p>"This work completed, the portion of No. 2 column
under Lieutenant-Colonel Durnford will move towards the
mission station near the Empand-leni hill, whilst No. 3
column advances to a fresh position near the Isipezi hill,
detaching, if necessary, part of its force to support No. 2
column.</p>

<p>"These combined moves will, I hope, have the effect
of removing any dangerously large body from the Natal
border.</p>

<p>"Colonel Wood, commanding No. 4 column, has been
informed of these intended movements, and has been
instructed to act together independently about the head
waters of the White Umvoloosi river.</p>

<p>"When Cetywayo has either surrendered or been
defeated, which can only take a few more days to decide,
Colonel Wood will take up a position covering Utrecht and
the adjacent Transvaal border, wherever he considers his
force can be most usefully employed. He will not attempt
to advance towards the Inhlazatze mountain until an
advance by the other three columns across the Umhlatoosi
river has become possible.</p>

<p>"By these movements I hope to be able to clear that
portion of Zululand which is situated south of the Umhlatoosi
river, and behind a straight line drawn from the head
waters of that river to the head waters of the White
Umvoloosi river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The fatal twenty-second of January.</i></div>

<p>"Should the Swazies come down to the Pongolo river,
that part of Zululand which is behind a straight line drawn
from the head waters of the Umvoloosi river to the junction
of the Bevan and Pongolo rivers, will also, no doubt, be
abandoned, and possibly as far as the Lebombo mountains.</p>

<p>"I trust that this plan of campaign will meet with the
approval of the High Commissioner.</p>

<p>"From a military point of view I am convinced that
it is the only practicable one at this time of year, and if
successfully carried out, is capable of producing very satisfactory
results.</p>

<p>"I am equally confident that, politically, it will also
have good results.</p>

<p>"We shall occupy a large extent of Zululand, and shall
threaten the portion which remains to the king. We shall
completely cover the Natal border, and shall to a considerable
extent do the same for the Transvaal. We expect
Cetywayo to keep his army mobilized, and it is clear his
troops will have difficulty in finding sufficient supplies."</p>

<p>On the 20th of January, 1879, the camp of the third
column was at the Isandhlwana mountain. This force was
under the command of Colonel Glyn, C.B., and the general
commanding had accompanied it from the Tugela river.
On the date just quoted, orders were given to Commandant
Lonsdale and Major Dartnell to go out the following
morning, and make a forward movement with a force composed
of Native Contingent, Police, and Volunteers. On the
next day (21st January), Major Dartnell sent in word that
the enemy was near him in considerable force. Upon this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Lord Chelmsford ordered the 2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment,
the mounted infantry, and four guns, to be under arms at
once, and this force left so soon as there was light enough
to see the road. Before Lord Chelmsford left, he sent the
following order to Lieutenant-Colonel Durnford, commanding
No. 2 column:&mdash;"Move up to Isandhlwana camp at
once with all your mounted men and rocket battery. Take
command of it. I am accompanying Colonel Glyn, who
is moving off at once to attack Matyana and a Zulu force
said to be twelve or fourteen miles off, and at present
watched by Natal Police, Volunteers, and Natal Native Contingent.
Colonel Glyn takes with him 2-24th Regiment,
four guns R.A., and Mounted Infantry."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Major Clery,
senior staff officer to the third column, says&mdash;"Before
leaving the camp I sent written instructions to Colonel
Pulleine, 24th Regiment, to the following effect:&mdash;'You
will be in command of the camp during the absence of
Colonel Glyn. Draw in' (I speak from memory) 'your
camp, or your line of defence,'&mdash;I am not certain which&mdash;'while
the force is out. Also draw in the line of your
infantry outposts accordingly; but keep your cavalry
vedettes still far advanced.' I went to Colonel Pulleine's

those instructions, and I again repeated them verbally to
him."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Captain Alan Gardiner, of the 14th Hussars, states
that he left the camp with Lord Chelmsford on the 22nd of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
January, and was sent back into camp with an order from
the general, between 10 and 11 a.m. that day. Colonel
Pulleine was informed that the camp of the force out was
to be struck, and sent on immediately; "also rations and
forage for about seven days." This order came too late.
At the moment of its receipt Colonel Durnford was falling
back and begging Colonel Pulleine to send him reinforcements,
and the enemy began to appear in large numbers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Intentions of the Zulus.</i></div>

<p>In order to make the proceedings of this fatal day more
easily understood, it is now necessary to advert to the proceedings
of the Zulu army. This was 20,000 strong, and
consisted of the Undi corps, the Nokenke and Umcityu
regiments, and the Nkobamakosi and Inbonambi regiments.
These comprised the flower of Cetywayo's troops. During
the night of the 21st of January they were ordered to move
in small detached bodies to a position about a mile and a
half to the east of the camp at Isandhlwana, on a stony
table-land, only about 1000 yards distant from the spot
visited by Lord Chelmsford and Colonel Glyn on the
afternoon of the 21st of January. No fires were lighted, and
the stillness of death was preserved. The centre was
occupied by the Undi corps, the right wing by the Nokenke
and Umcityu, and the left by the Inbonambi and the
Nkobamakosi regiments. The king's orders comprised a
simple command to drive the third column back into Natal.
But there was no intention whatever of making an attack
upon the 22nd of January. The state of the moon was unfavourable,
the usual medicine sprinkling had not taken
place, nor had the war-song been chanted. What superstition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
forbade was, however, conceded to expediency.
When the division of the British forces was noticed, and
their gross ignorance and carelessness observed, the Zulu
leaders felt like Cromwell, when he exclaimed, with reference
to the Scottish army, "The Lord has delivered them
into our hands."</p>

<p>On the morning of the 22nd of January, the mounted
Basutos sent out under the command of Colonel Durnford
fired upon the Umcityu regiment. This was too favourable
an opportunity to be neglected. Here was a portion only
of the third column, with an unfortified camp, whose defenders
were scattering themselves over a large space, utterly
ignorant and careless of the fact that the overwhelming
and concentrated Zulu force was close beside them. The
charge of the Umcityu regiment was immediately and
vigorously followed by that of the Nokenke, Inbonambi,
and Nkobamikosi regiments, the Undi corps holding its
ground. Up to this time in the day there had been no
fighting. Early in the morning, not long after the departure
of the general, a body of the Native Contingent
had been sent out to scout, and either did not see or
pretended not to see any enemy. About 9 a.m. Colonel
Durnford, R.E., arrived with 250 mounted men and 250
native infantry, who were at once divided into three bodies
and scattered to the left east, the left front, and the rear.
So far from a plan of concentration being adopted, the very
opposite course was pursued. It was the force sent to the
left east that was attacked by the Zulu army. No further
concealment was now necessary, and messengers arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
informing Colonel Durnford that an enormous force was
advancing. A consultation then took place between that
officer and Colonel Pulleine, when some difference of
opinion seemed to prevail. A company of the 1st Battalion,
24th Regiment, was then immediately moved up to a
distance of about a mile and a half from the camp,
where, at a neck of the Isandhlwana hill, an attempt was
made to check the advance of the Zulu army. For a very
short time only this man&oelig;uvre was successful.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Zulu attack.</i></div>

<p>The Zulu army now advanced in a steady, quiet, and
determined manner. The Umcityu regiment formed the
right centre, and was engaged with one company of the
1st Battalion, 24th Regiment, and about 200 of Colonel
Durnford's natives; the left centre was composed of the
Nokenke regiment, which was shelled by the two guns as it
advanced. Next on the left, came the Imbonambi regiment,
with the Nkobamakosi regiment outside of it, both making
a turning movement and threatening the front of the
camp, while driving before them a body of Colonel Durnford's
mounted men, supported by a patrol of volunteers.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
The Undi corps, on seeing that the other four regiments
had commenced the attack, concealed themselves on the
north side of the Isandhlwana mountain, and so turned
as to arrive at the western front where the waggon road
crosses the neck. On the left front of the camp our infantry
behaved with extreme gallantry, and succeeded in
thrice repulsing the Nkobamakosi regiment; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Inbonambi regiment coming up as a reinforcement, enabled
the Zulus to push forward along the south front
of the camp and accomplish their turning movement. The
guns were moved to the right of the Native Contingent,
and troops lined the nullah below; three companies of the
1-24th remained on the left of the camp, supported by
Durnford's mounted Basutos, who had been driven back.
The single company of the 1-24th, which had been thrown
out a mile and a half from the camp, was retiring, fighting
to the best of their ability, and, of course, was cut off to
a man.</p>

<p>The Zulu army was fast surrounding the camp. They
had been held only partially in check by our fire, and
their own was remarkably ineffective. Their overwhelming
numbers and their extremely advantageous position filled
them with redoubled courage. In place of advancing
steadily and in silence, they now began to double and
to shout exultantly to each other. The Native Contingent
and camp-followers fled in all directions, seized by panic;
the Undi corps showed itself on the right rear of the camp,
cutting off retreat to Rorke's Drift, and a hand-to-hand
combat against overwhelming odds was imminent. Like
the sea breaking against land, the Zulu host came on
invincibly, with overwhelming power and strength. Then
took place one of the most awful tragedies ever recorded
in the pages of history. With short stabbing assegais, on
rushed the naked savages, accompanying the death groans
of their victims with yells and shouts of triumph. No
mercy was either expected or granted. Hundreds of men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
overpowered by brute force, fell at their posts, and their fate
was rendered more pitiable, as well as more blamable, by a
failure in the supply of ammunition.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The camp at Isandhlwana.</i></div>

<p>From first to last, nothing could have been worse
managed than the defence of our camp at Isandhlwana.
Profound ignorance and rashness caused the dispersion of
a force which, if formed in hollow square&mdash;or better still,
laagered in accordance with the Dutch custom&mdash;would have
defied the enemy, at least until such time as the general,
with the rest of the third column, could have arrived. The
lamentable spectacle was seen at Isandhlwana of brave
soldiers sacrificed through the most glaring incompetency
and folly. For the British infantry there was no opportunity
of escape&mdash;death at their post on the field of
battle was inevitable; but for the mounted men a chance
occurred in consequence of the Nkobamakosi regiment
neglecting to make a junction with the Undi. This was
taken advantage of by a crowd of fugitives. In the flight
many were killed before the Buffalo river was reached, and
many were drowned and shot when trying to cross it. The
Zulus, however, had themselves suffered severely. The
Umcityu lost heavily from the fire of the single company
of the 24th Regiment which was sent out from camp never
to return, the Nkobamakosi fell in heaps, and the hill
down which the Nokenke came was covered with slain.
As regards the British troops, our loss comprised 62 men
of the N Battery, 5th Brigade, Royal Artillery; 7 of the
Royal Engineers, including Colonel Durnford; 405 of the
1st Battalion, 24th Regiment, including Lieutenant-Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Pulleine, Captains Degacher, Mostyn, Wardell, and Younghusband
(Lieutenant and Adjutant Melvill was killed on
the western side of the Buffalo river, when most gallantly
defending the colours of his regiment, which were afterwards
found wrapped round his body); 165 men of the
2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment; Surgeon-Major Shepherd,
Army Medical Department; 12 Mounted Infantry; 26
Natal Mounted Police; 22 Natal Carbineers; 7 Newcastle
Mounted Rifles, and 3 Buffalo Borderguard; 37 of the 1st
Battalion, 3rd Regiment, Natal Native Contingent; 37 of
the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Regiment, Natal Native Contingent.
Among the Carbineers and other volunteer corps were the
sons of many of the leading inhabitants of Natal, and
in the Police also were many relatives of colonists.
The official lists comprising white men killed, publish more
than 770 names; but there is no doubt that, including the
loyal natives, quite 1000 of our men must have been slain.
All the baggage, guns, and ammunition became the property
of the enemy, and in the incredibly short space of
one hour from the beginning of the general attack, one
of the most signal victories possible had been gained by
the Zulu army. The number of white men who escaped
across the Buffalo river was about forty, in addition to
natives on horseback and foot. Of the former, about twenty-five
or thirty arrived at Helpmakaar between 5 and 6 p.m.
The Undi corps, believing that the camp had been plundered
by the other portions of their army, thought it desirable to
advance quickly on Rorke's Drift to secure the booty there,
and hurried off for this destination, little dreaming of the
possibility of any resistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ignorance of Lord Chelmsford.</i></div>

<p>While these occurrences had been taking place, Lord
Chelmsford, with Colonel Glyn and a large portion of the
third column, were absent in advance. On the 20th of
January, the general had made a reconnoissance as far as
a place called Matyana's stronghold&mdash;a deep valley, full of
caves. Not having time to examine this place thoroughly,
two separate parties were ordered out to bring back a full
description of it. One of these, under Major Dartnell,
reported that he found the enemy in force, and would be
able to attack if three companies of infantry were sent to
him. This was not acceded to. At 2.30 a.m. on the 22nd
of January, Colonel Glyn was ordered to move to Dartnell's
assistance with six companies 2-24th, four guns, and the
mounted infantry. Colonel Durnford was at the same time
ordered up to strengthen the Isandhlwana camp. The
general followed Colonel Glyn's reinforcements, and
reached Major Dartnell at 6.30 a.m. The enemy shortly
showed at a distance, but retreated when a general advance
was made. All this was, no doubt, part of the Zulu plan of
amusing this portion of our forces, and keeping them from
the Isandhlwana camp. The only actual engagement that
took place was at the extreme right, where 500 Zulus were
cut off, of whom 30 were killed. At 9 a.m. a short note
was received from Lieutenant-Colonel Pulleine, stating that
firing had been heard, but giving no further particulars.
Lieutenant Milne, A.D.C., was sent by the general to the
top of a high hill from which the camp could be seen, and
he remained there for at least an hour, with a very powerful
telescope, but could detect nothing unusual in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
direction. A site for a new camp was then fixed upon, and
the troops were ordered to bivouac there that night. The
general then started to return to camp with the mounted
infantry under Colonel Russell. When within six miles
from Isandhlwana, Lord Chelmsford found the 1st Battalion,
Native Contingent, halted, and shortly after Commandant
Lonsdale rode up to report that he had ridden into camp,
and found it in possession of the Zulus. Intimation had
been received so far back as between 9.30 and 10 a.m.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
that there was a force of the enemy in the close neighbourhood
of the camp. Major Clery at this time received a half
sheet of foolscap from Lieutenant-Colonel Pulleine, giving
him that information, and as the force was only twelve
miles from camp, an immediate rapid advance would have
saved the day. The exact words of this letter are not
given in the evidence, and are clearly of the utmost consequence.
It was after this, however, that Lieutenant
Milne, A.D.C., descended the hill, with the report that he
noticed nothing except the cattle being driven into camp.
This fact, however, was of great consequence, taken in
connection with the pressing nature of the despatch from
Colonel Pulleine. Notwithstanding all this, nothing was
suspected until the dreadful news came like a thunderclap,
that the camp had been taken and its defenders
killed. So soon as the general heard the awful news,
he sent back Major Gossett, A.D.C., to order Colonel
Glyn to advance with all his force. He was six miles
off, and it was then 4 p.m. The advance party, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
general, continued to go forward, until they were within
two miles from the camp, when they halted. Colonel
Russell went to the front to reconnoitre, and returned
about 5.45 with a report that "all was as bad as could
be." The Zulus held the camp. At 6 p.m. Colonel Glyn
came up with his troops, which, having been formed into
fighting order, were addressed by the general. No sign of
wavering was perceptible. They advanced with steady
courage, determined to attack and go through any enemy.
Guns in the centre; three companies 2-24th on each flank
in fours; Native Contingent; mounted infantry on extreme
right, Natal Mounted Volunteers on the extreme left;
Mounted Police in reserve;&mdash;in this order the force went
forward with great speed. The artillery shelled the crest
of the narrow neck over which the line of retreat lay, and
positions were seized without opposition. The curtain of
night had fallen over the dreadful scene of carnage, and
the entire force, tired and dispirited, lay down amidst
the <i>débris</i> of the plundered camp and the corpses of men,
horses, and oxen. The weariness and sorrow of these
hours of darkness will never be forgotten. The troops
fully expected to be attacked in front and rear; but fortunately
the Zulus knew better how to gain than how to
improve a victory, and although there were several alarms,
not a shot was fired, and Lord Chelmsford, with the
remnant of his forces, was able at dawn of day to hurry
on to the relief of Rorke's Drift.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The disaster discovered.</i></div>

<p>On the 22nd of January, Lieutenant Chard, R.E., was
left in command at Rorke's Drift by Major Spalding, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
went to Helpmakaar to hurry on the company of the 24th
Regiment ordered to protect the ponts. About 3.15 p.m.
of that day, two men came riding furiously from Zululand,
and shouted to be taken across the river. These were
Lieutenant Adendorff, of Lonsdale's regiment, and a carbineer.
The former remained to assist in the defence;
the latter galloped off to take the intelligence to Helpmakaar.
The news was of the frightful disaster at Isandhlwana&mdash;that
the Zulus were advancing on the colony in
force, and that Rorke's Drift must, therefore, be held at all
cost. Lieutenant Bromhead, who commanded the company
of the 24th Regiment at the camp near the commissariat
stores, had just then received a note from the third column,
and sent for Lieutenant Chard. Preparations for defence
were made with the utmost vigour. Separate buildings
were connected by walls of mealie-bags and two waggons;
the store building and hospital were loopholed and
barricaded. All available materials were made use of,
and the brave little garrison determined to repulse the
enemy or die behind their frail entrenchments.</p>

<p>At the river the ferryman, Daniells, and Sergeant Milne,
3rd Buffs, offered to moor the pont in the middle of the
stream, and with a few men fight from its deck; but this
offer was declined, and the brave fellows who made it were
enrolled among the garrison.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Rorke's Drift.</i></div>

<p>The sound of firing was heard at 4.20 p.m. Previously,
an officer of Durnford's had been requested to send outposts
in the direction of the enemy, and to check their advances
as much as possible. His men, however, would not obey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
orders, and rode off, 100 in number, to Helpmakaar.
About the same time, Captain Stephenson, with his detachment
of Natal Native Contingent, left the little garrison.
The line of defence was at once seen to be too extended for
the small number of men that were left, and a new entrenchment
of biscuit-boxes had at once to be commenced. The
wall had only been built two boxes high, when, at 4.30 p.m.,
600 Zulus were seen advancing at a run against the south
wall. They were met by a well-sustained fire, but, notwithstanding
their heavy loss, continued to advance within
fifty yards. Here they encountered the additional cross-fire
from the store and were checked. Unfortunately, however,
some were able to take advantage of the shelter afforded by
the cook-house ovens, etc. By far the larger number never
stopped, but moved to the left, round the hospital, and made
a rush at the north-west wall of mealie-bags. A desperate
bayonet struggle took place here, which resulted in the
repulse of the enemy with heavy loss.</p>

<p>The bush in the immediate neighbourhood, which had
not been cut down, enabled the Zulus to advance under
cover close to the wall. A number of desperate assaults
were made, all of which were most splendidly met and
repulsed by the bayonet.</p>

<p>A very harassing fire was encountered from the rocks,
which caused severe loss, and about 6 p.m. obliged a
retreat behind the entrenchment of the biscuit-boxes.
While all this was going on, the Zulus had been attempting
to force the hospital, and shortly afterwards set fire to its
roof. The garrison there most gallantly defended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
building from floor to floor, bringing out all the sick that
could be moved. Four privates of the 24th Regiment
(Williams, Hook, R. Jones, and W. Jones) were the last
men to leave, holding the doorway with the bayonet, their
own ammunition being exhausted.</p>

<p>Mealie-bags were then converted into a sort of redoubt,
which gave a second line of fire all round. While this was
being done, the hospital was in flames, and the enemy
continued to make desperate attempts to fire the roof of
the stores. Shortly before darkness came on, the gallant
little force was completely surrounded, and, after repulsing
several attacks, felt compelled to retire to the centre of
their entrenchments. The vigour of the siege continued
until after midnight, and then it lapsed into a desultory
fire, which was kept up all night.</p>

<p>About 4 a.m. on the 23rd of January, the firing ceased,
and at daybreak the enemy was out of sight over the hill
to the south-west. The number of the defending force was
exactly 104,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and that of the Zulus who attacked about
3000. No fewer than 350 of the enemy were killed.
Thus was the colony of Natal saved by the undaunted
resolution of a little band of heroes whose conduct rivals
that of the men of Thermopylæ.</p>

<p>At about 7 a.m. a large body of the enemy were seen
advancing. No reinforcements had arrived from Helpmakaar,
although they had been specially sent for, and
the ammunition was almost expended. At about 8 a.m.
the third column providentially appeared in sight, and Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Chelmsford and staff soon afterwards galloped up to
Rorke's Drift and warmly congratulated its gallant defenders.
They had by their undaunted bravery and firm
attitude before an overwhelming force of the enemy done
much to neutralize the effect of the disaster at Isandhlwana,
and, Lord Chelmsford himself officially reports,
"no doubt saved Natal from a serious invasion." He adds,
"The cool, determined courage displayed by the gallant
garrison is beyond all praise, and will, I feel sure, receive
ample recognition."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Natal saved.</i></div>

<p>The disaster at Isandhlwana, looked at correctly, confirms
most strongly the arguments advanced by the High
Commissioner in favour of the war. It became perfectly
evident that the Zulu king had an army at his command
which could, almost any day, unexpectedly invade Natal;
and, owing to the great extent of frontier and character
of the natives within the colony, they might have devastated
the country without the possibility of being adequately
checked. To use the words of Sir Bartle Frere, it would
have been vain&mdash;almost criminal&mdash;to ignore the fact that
there had grown up by our sufferance alongside Natal a
very powerful military organization, directed by an irresponsible,
bloodthirsty, and treacherous despot. This
extraordinary power simply made the existence of a
peaceful English community so precarious as to prevent
its safe continuance in any other form than that of an
armed camp. So soon as the news of Isandhlwana reached
the colony, a terrible panic was the result. The inhabitants
fled to the towns, laagers were formed in every direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
while in D'Urban and Pietermaritzburg entrenchments and
fortifications were at once erected. The heroic defence of
Rorke's Drift and the providential flooding of the Tugela
river were the means of saving the colony. Flushed with
victory, nothing would have been able to withstand the
Zulu armies, if they had crossed the boundary and, in their
well-organized form, entered Natal.</p>

<p>As a result of the Isandhlwana disaster, the native
allies could no longer be trusted, and melted away by
means of desertion. Lord Chelmsford was obliged to
report that large British reinforcements were absolutely
required if the operations against the Zulus were to be
carried to a successful issue. Three British infantry
regiments, two cavalry regiments, and one company of
Royal Engineers, as well as 100 artillerymen, were asked
for. When the request reached England, it was immediately
granted, but a fearful period of suspense and
anxiety intervened. It is difficult to pourtray in words the
feelings of the white inhabitants of Natal, who every
moment expected to hear that a savage, ruthless foe was
in full march for the purpose of utterly exterminating the
hated white race. Sixty miles only intervened between
D'Urban and the Tugela river; Pietermaritzburg was still
more exposed. Numbers of people fled to the seaboard,
and thence to the neighbouring colony; while, behind
laagers and hastily constructed fortifications, the people
waited in expectant terror for every item of news from the
theatre of war. In the Cape colony, the most vigorous
measures were adopted by its Government. Two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
volunteers from Cape Town, and 100 from Port Elizabeth,
proceeded immediately to King William's Town and relieved
the 88th Regiment, ordered to Natal; 900 mounted
yeomanry were called out to occupy certain positions on
the border, in conjunction with 800 Cape Mounted Riflemen.
Two thousand Europeans were thus placed under arms,
1700 of whom were mounted men. This was really
necessary in order to keep down possible insurrections
of Pondos, Basutos, and Griquas. All the black races
throughout Southern Africa had to be feared, as they only
waited an opportunity to make common cause against the
Europeans. Already in detail had the Gealekas and the
Gaikas been thoroughly defeated, but the Basutos and
Pondos had hitherto hung back. The Zulu war was
watched by them with lively feelings of interest and their
sympathies were, of course, enlisted on the side of Cetywayo.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Feeling in England.</i></div>

<p>Her Majesty the Queen, with the utmost sympathy and
promptness, caused the Secretary of State to telegraph,
on the 18th of February, her sorrow at the loss of so many
brave officers and men of the regular and colonial forces,
and her full confidence that Lord Chelmsford would be able
to meet the difficulties in which he was placed. The
message ended with the words, "Full reinforcements of
all arms will be sent with the utmost despatch."</p>

<p>The Imperial Ministry was fiercely attacked in England
for having entered upon the Zulu war, and succumbed to
the pressure of public opinion so far as to blame Sir Bartle
Frere for taking, without their full knowledge and sanction,
a course almost certain to result in war, which every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
effort should have been used to avoid. The High Commissioner,
under his commission, was not only empowered,
but really authorized and obliged, to enter upon this war.
His Excellency knew that it was necessary to open the campaign
at once in Zululand; and the mild, modified rebuke
of the Conservative Ministry was evidently wrung from
them more by the exigencies of party than by the actual
circumstances. A disaster always evokes a cry for victims,
and the British populace were loud in the usual <i>væ victis</i>
clamour. Sir Bartle Frere, however, stood firm, strong
in the confidence of eventually obtaining justice; while the
Ministry at home were sufficiently powerful and sufficiently
noble to refuse to sacrifice Lord Chelmsford to the ferocious
outcry that was raised against him.</p>

<p class="p1">The difficulties of transport were considerable, and the
immense train of waggons not only delayed progress, but
made an attack, when the troops were in motion, more
difficult to resist. Nothing of consequence occurred on the
march, excepting the destruction of a large military kraal.
The enemy, however, hovered about the column, and only
waited for a favourable opportunity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lieutenant-Colonel Pearson's column.</i></div>

<p class="b1">At last, on the 22nd of January, the day of Isandhlwana,
the march was commenced at 5 a.m. After
passing five miles along a fertile valley, the path turned
suddenly to the left, and the ascent of the high land on
which Ekowe is situated commenced. The head of the
column reached the turning, and was preparing to halt for
breakfast, when it was suddenly attacked along the entire
right flank and on both fronts. The Zulus had been lying
in ambush. Rushing from bush to bush, and firing with
great rapidity, they advanced in extended order so as to
come within a distance of 150 yards. Their advance was
checked by the heavy fire from two 7-pounders, Royal
Artillery, and two 24-pounder Naval Brigade rockets,
placed on a knoll at the foot of the pass commanding the
valley from which the flank attack proceeded. Two companies
of the Buffs, as well as A and B companies of the
Naval Brigade, assisted in holding this position, and poured
in a steady fire. While these proceedings were going on
under the personal direction of Colonel Pearson, the
waggons continued to park, and as soon as the length of
the column had sufficiently decreased, two companies of
the Buffs, which had been guarding the waggons, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
directed to clear the enemy out of the bush. Led by Captains
Harrison and Wild, they got into skirmishing order,
and in good style drove the Zulus back into the open plain,
where they were effectually swept by rockets, shells, and
musketry. The main body of the mounted infantry, under
Major Barrow and Captain Wynne, were now able to move
forward. An attempt to outflank on the part of the enemy
was defeated by the Naval Brigade and a part of the Native
Contingent. Shortly afterwards, a brilliant and successful
attack was made upon heights where a considerable body
of Zulus were posted. The Zulus then fled in all directions,
and a complete victory was gained.</p>

</table>


<p class="p1">The plan of fighting by the Zulus was in accordance
with their usual well-organized scheme. The formation of
their attack is in the figure of a beast, with horns, chest,
and loins. They usually make a feint with one horn, whilst
the other, concealed by long grass or bush, sweeps round
for the purpose of encompassing its enemy. The chest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
then advances, and endeavours by its vast power to crush
opposition. The loins are kept at a distance and only join
in pursuit.</p>

<p>The action of Inyezani lasted exactly one hour and a
half, commencing at 8 a.m. and the last shot being fired at
9.30 a.m. The British loss was 12 killed and 16 wounded,
while of the Zulus 300 were slain. It is conjectured that
the attacking force comprised nearly 5000 men.</p>

<p>After the battle was over the column calmly resumed
the even tenor of its way, and at night bivouacked on a
high ridge distant only three miles from the battle-field.
The road led up a winding and steep ascent, and on the
23rd of January, after marching six miles further, Ekowe
was reached. The intention was to leave surplus stores
here, with a small garrison, and push on to Cetywayo's
kraal at Ulundi. But these plans had to be completely
changed. On the 29th of January, about noon, a messenger
galloped in from Lord Chelmsford with the news
of the fearful disaster at Isandhlawana, and that the entire
Zulu army might be expected to attack them. Colonel
Pearson had to decide either to hold the fort, or to march
back, at once and quickly, to the Tugela river. A council
of war was assembled, and, by a small majority, it was
resolved to maintain their position at all costs. The result
proved that this was a wise determination.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The camp at Ekowe.</i></div>

<p>In order to husband resources, all the cavalry, with the
two battalions of Native Contingent, were sent back, and by
this means the garrison lost all means of obtaining information
of the enemy's movements. The Victoria, Stanger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and D'Urban Mounted Rifles, as well as the Natal Hussars,
and two battalions of the Natal Native Contingent, rode
away at 2 p.m. of the day on which the order was given,
and at midnight arrived safely on the banks of the Tugela,
not having seen a Zulu on the way. Colonel Ely, <i>en route</i>
with supplies, was directed to hasten on to Ekowe, and, in
order to do so more effectually, abandoned eight waggons,
with their contents of flour, biscuit, lime-juice, sugar, etc.
On the 30th of January, all the troops came inside the
embryo fort; tents were no longer allowed, and officers
and men were obliged to huddle together under waggons.
The garrison consisted of 1339 whites and 355 blacks,
of whom 47 whites and 290 blacks were non-combatants.
The armament comprised 1200 Martini rifles, with 330
rounds per rifle; 1 Gatling, with 127,000 rounds; 2 rocket
tubes, with 83 rockets; and 2 7-pounders, with 500 rounds.</p>

<p>The garrison had 3000 oxen, but were obliged to drive
away a large number, and soon learned, by the loss of 90
slaughter oxen from the ditch of the parapet, that large
numbers of Zulus were close at hand. The fort soon
attained a respectable appearance. It was oblong in shape&mdash;east
and west sides, 300 yards each; north side, 120
yards; south, 180 yards. Waggons were placed round the
inside of the parapet, a few yards distant. The church was
converted into a hospital, the schoolroom and parsonage
into storerooms, and all other buildings were demolished.
All hands were up at réveille, and engaged all day in
making the fort, and, when that was completed, in making
roads. At 8 p.m. the "last post" sounded, and then all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
gave themselves to sleep, often broken by the alarm of the
church bell, when the parapets were manned at once. A
few irregular horse had been enrolled, who did outpost
duty during the day. At this time an army of 20,000
Zulus was lying in wait between Ekowe and the Tugela.</p>

<p>Lord Chelmsford desired Colonel Pearson to reduce his
garrison, and to establish a portion of it at the Tugela
forts; but this was clearly impossible, and it is very surprising
that such an order could ever have been issued.
On the 6th of February, Colonel Pearson wrote, suggesting
that twenty waggons, with a convoy, should be sent. In
reply, the general sent word that there would not be a
force at Lower Tugela for six weeks sufficient to insure a
convoy to Ekowe, but wished the garrison there reduced
and a flying column formed. This was quite out of the
question, and, of course, was not attempted. On the 10th
of February the fort was completed, with ditches seven feet
deep and twelve feet wide, flanked by <i>caponnières</i> or by
the parapet itself; wire entanglements on the glacis, and
stakes in the ditch. The two 7-pounders were at the
south-east and south-west angles, the rocket battery at the
north-west, and the Gatling on the east face of the parapet.</p>

<p>The stench, at night particularly, was absolutely sickening,
although every effort was made to keep the camp
clean. Rations soon had to be reduced. A bottle of pickles
fetched 25<i>s.</i>; sardines, 12<i>s.</i>; tin of milk, 23<i>s.</i>; a ham, £7
10<i>s.</i> There was always, however, a sufficient quantity of
food of a coarse description, and the only famine that the
garrison really suffered from was a dearth of news. Intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of how the war was going on, and of the outside
world, was greedily and earnestly thirsted for. Convoys
were always looked for and never arrived. No attack was
ever made upon the fort by the wily Zulus, although they
lay in wait for any opportunity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Life at the camp.</i></div>

<p>The defence of Rorke's Drift had not only saved Natal
from destruction, but Ekowe from attack. Affairs dragged
on in a dull, monotonous manner all through February
until the beginning of March. From a slight elevation
near the camp the Lower Tugela could be seen, and H.M.S.
<i>Active</i> cruising on the coast. Many a time were eyes
stretched over the thirty-five miles of country intervening
between Ekowe and Natal for some sign of relief and of
succour.</p>

<p>An officer in Ekowe says, "The troops inside consisted
of three companies of the 99th Regiment, five companies
of the 2-3rd Buffs, one company Royal Engineers, one
company of the Pioneers, the Naval Brigade, a body of
artillery, and nineteen of the Native Contingent, amongst
them being several non-commissioned officers, whom we
found exceedingly useful, two of them being at once selected
as butchers, whilst two others were 'promoted' to the
rank of 'bakers to the troops.' Others attended to the
sanitary arrangements of the garrison, and altogether they
were found to be also exceedingly useful. As a portion of
the column the company of pioneers under the command
of Captain Beddoes did a great deal of very important
work. This company was composed of ninety-eight natives,
one captain, and three lieutenants, and their proceedings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
in connection with the making of the new road were watched
with much interest. They worked with the Naval Brigade,
about three companies of soldiers, and several men of the
Royal Artillery. This road was found useless in consequence
of the numerous swampy places at the foot of each
of the numerous hills which occurred along the route.
Very thick bush had to be cut through, and at first but
slow progress was made. The road, as is generally known,
took a direction towards the Inyezane. Whilst out on one
occasion, the road party saw a torpedo explosion, which
took place about three miles from where the party was
working. It had been accidentally fired by Kafirs, who
were unaware of the dangers connected with the implement,
and it is believed that several of them were killed. The
road was altogether a bad one. The relief column used it
on their way up, but only the pioneers and the mounted
men went by that route on the way back. In fact, it would
have been useless to have attempted to use it for the
passage of waggons. Whenever the road party went out
they were fired on by Kafirs, but of course shots were
returned, and many a Zulu warrior was knocked over
whilst the work was being proceeded with. Everything in
camp was conducted in a most orderly manner. We were
roused at half-past five, sharp, and at eight o'clock, sharp,
lights were out. For one month we existed very comfortably
on full rations, but at the end of that time we were
put on short rations, made up as follow:&mdash;One pound and
a quarter of trek oxen beef, six ounces of meal, one ounce
and a quarter of sugar, third of an ounce of coffee, onesixth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of an ounce of tea, one-ninth of an ounce of pepper,
and a quarter of an ounce of salt. Life of course was very
monotonous. The bands of the two regiments played on
alternate afternoons, and every morning they were to be
heard practising outside the entrenchment. The most
pleasant part of the day was just after six o'clock, when we
used to be enlivened in the cool of the evening by the fife and
drum band, playing the 'retreat.' The water with which
we were supplied was indeed excellent, and the bathing
places, I need not say, were very extensively patronized.
The grazing was not nearly sufficient for the cattle, and
from the first they must have suffered very much from
want of nourishment. You will have heard of the fate
of the 1100 head of oxen and the span of donkeys which we
sent away from the camp in expectation of their reaching
the Lower Tugela. They left us in charge of nineteen
Kafirs; but at the Inyezane they were attacked by a large
body of Kafirs. The natives in charge of the cattle decamped
and reached the fort in safety, and the enemy got
possession of the whole of the cattle, which they drove off.
The donkeys were all killed, with the exception of one, and
this sagacious animal surprised everybody in camp by
returning soon after the Kafirs had come back."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Movements of Cetewayo.</i></div>

<p>Shortly after the disaster at Isandhlwana, the main
body of the Zulu army went up to the king to be doctored
with charms taken from the mutilated bodies of the killed
of the English army. The intended movements of Cetywayo
were described as follows:&mdash;"When the doctoring is
done, the king will order a still stronger force than that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
22nd January; perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 to attack in one
mass Colonel Glynn's column, and if they succeed, then
attack Colonel Wood's column; but if they do not succeed
in doing this, he will try to check and harass the English
columns in Zululand by man&oelig;uvring a sufficient number
of soldiers around them, and simultaneously make strong
impetuous raids into the colony, as he has prohibited his
people making raids in small numbers; he has furthermore
plainly and repeatedly expressed himself to the effect that
if he is to lose his life and kingdom, he will first make such
havoc in Natal that it for ever shall be remembered." The
truth is that something little short of a universal panic
prevailed, which only by degrees subsided as time passed on
without any invasion, and leisure was allowed for reflection.
It does not seem to have been remembered that in every
direction except one, and by all the columns except that of
Colonel Glyn, the Zulus were defeated. Isandhlwana was
a purely exceptional case, entirely attributable to blundering
of the most gross and evident character. The defence
of Rorke's Drift and the battle of Ineyezani were most significant.
At the former a handful of infantry defended themselves
successfully behind mealie-bags and biscuit-boxes
against three times their number; at the latter, an overwhelming
force was easily defeated in the field by the
simple strategy of common sense.</p>

<p>No. 4 column, under Colonel Wood, operated in the
north and acted as a means of defence to Utrecht and the
Transvaal. It was assisted from the first by a number of
irregulars and volunteers. Successful forays were made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
on various occasions, but it would be tedious to do more
than refer to these, although the greatest gallantry and
skill were exhibited. Colonel Wood most deservedly increased
his reputation as a brilliant and successful leader.
A fort was established at Kambula hill, entrenched in such
a manner as to defy the attacks of a savage enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Discontent among the Boers.</i></div>

<p>February was a month of suspense. Cetywayo had an
opportunity of which he did not avail himself, but was
contented with reorganizing and reanointing his armies.
Colonel Pearson remained at Ekowe; forts were placed
on the Tugela river; mounted forces were distributed along
the border from Fort Pearson to Thring's Post. There
was, in addition, a border guard of white officers and natives,
about 1500 strong. "Stanger"&mdash;fifteen miles on the Natal
side&mdash;as well as D'Urban, Maritzburg, and every town of
the least consequence, was fortified, and then volunteer and
citizen soldiers prepared themselves for any emergency.
The High Commissioner, Sir Bartle Frere, who had proceeded
to Natal on the outbreak of hostilities, still remained
at Pietermaritzburg, and was there in the best possible
position for giving that advice and assistance so necessary
in the serious emergencies in which a British colony and a
British general were placed. Unfortunately, many of the
people of Dutch extraction in the Transvaal seemed to take
the opportunity for loudly protesting against the annexation
of that territory to the Crown, then recently effected
by Sir Theophilus Shepstone. A people's committee was
appointed, and a firm determination expressed to regain
that republican liberty of which they believed they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
been unjustly deprived. One of the most satisfactory
events of this month was the evident desire of the king's
brother, Oham, to be regarded as our friend. His country
lay in the north-west of Zululand, and at an interview held
with Colonel Wood, conditions of surrender were arranged.
Early in March he came in with more than 600 people.</p>

<p>Under the orders and with the connivance of Cetywayo,
the chiefs Umbellini and Manyanyoba perpetrated the
most horrid cruelties. Atrocious outrages had been committed
long previously, but the Transvaal republican
authorities had not apparently considered it expedient to
report them fully. The little town of Luneberg was undoubtedly
saved by a company of troops sent there by
Colonel Wood. This officer had it in his power, when
passing through Manyanyoba's country, to crush him and
his warriors, but accepted in good faith the statement of
that chief, professing a desire to come under the British
Government. In spite of this, on the 10th of February,
a Zulu war party, led by Umbellini, crossed the Pongolo,
and was joined on the north by a strong force of
Manyanyoba's people, led by Manyanyoba himself.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The
combined force consisted of 1500 men. At half-past 3 a.m.
of the 11th February, they reached the mission station of
the Rev. Mr. Wagner, only four miles from Luneberg, and
then commenced a scene of most atrocious murder. Men,
women, and children were massacred. The houses of the
Christian natives were given to the flames, and no fewer
than seven children were burnt alive. From Wagner's they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
went to Nomapela's kraal, where they killed two men,
eleven women, and fifteen children. Thence they proceeded
to Luhlanya's kraal, where they murdered one
man, two women, and two children. But it is unnecessary
to prolong the narrative; suffice it to say that they went
through the country with fire and sword, sparing neither
age nor sex, and plundering wherever they had an opportunity.
Bodies of women and children were found frightfully
mutilated, and at Mr. Wagner's house a woman was found
still alive, who bore thirty-seven assegai wounds on her body.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Life at Helpmakaar.</i></div>

<p>The movements of the main Zulu army were mysterious.
One day scouts arrived with the information that the
enemy was in force between the Tugela and Ekowe;
another day information was received that there was an
army beyond the later place. The plan adopted on our
side was simply to entrench and wait. A dull, monotonous
round of garrison duty had to be performed at a number
of posts, while the danger was so great and imminent as
to turn every citizen into a soldier, and every town into a
barrack. As a specimen of life at a fort, we quote from a
correspondent who writes in February from "Helpmakaar:"
"Here we are, foot artillery, police, and contingent, about
500 strong, living in tents during the day and going into
the fort at night. With the exception of a stink of rotten
mealies and the rain continually swelling through and
through, the fort is not so bad, being so strong and well
built that the men here now could hold it against the whole
of the Zulu army. It is not healthy. Hospital leaks.
What with guards, vedettes, etc., the duties are very heavy."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
What was said at Helpmakaar might have been said with
very little variation at every other fort. The most active
operations were carried on from Colonel Wood's column,
whose head-quarters were entrenched at Kambula. Among
its brilliant exploits was the capture, on the 20th February,
of the almost inaccessible Makkatees mountain. One of the
captured natives said that our troops had not come a day
too soon, as Cetywayo had promised to send reinforcements.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Arrival of reinforcements.</i></div>

<p>The first ship to arrive with reinforcements was H.M.S.
<i>Shah</i>, which anchored at Port Natal on Thursday, the 6th
of March. The troops available by her were 392 men of
the Naval Brigade and 200 men from the St. Helena
garrison.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Baker and Lonsdale's Light Horse, as well as
other irregulars, were recruited in the Cape Colony, and
sent on by degrees. The first steamer from England to
arrive with reinforcements was the <i>Pretoria</i>, of the Union
Royal Mail Steam Shipping Company's fleet. She made
the run to Natal in less than twenty-four days, and had
on board 34 officers, 7 staff officers, and 890 men of the
71st Highlanders. The British soldiers were received in
Natal with the utmost enthusiasm, as saviours of the
country. Each ship and each regiment was eagerly looked
for and gladly welcomed. Previous to the <i>Pretoria</i>, the
57th Regiment had arrived from Ceylon in H.M. troopship
<i>Tamar</i>. The Secretary of War telegraphed, on the 13th
of February, to Lord Chelmsford that the following reinforcements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
had been placed under immediate orders for
Natal:&mdash;Two regiments of cavalry, each 648 men and
480 horses; two field batteries of artillery, 336 men and
220 horses; one field company of Engineers; five regiments
of infantry from home, each 806 men; 57th Regiment from
Ceylon; three companies Army Reserve Corps, 140 men,
380 horses; Army Hospital Corps, 140; drafts for the
57th, the 24th, and Royal Artillery. The steamers employed
to bring out these troops were&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">These magnificent steamships used the utmost despatch,
and in little more than twenty days<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> from England each
one arrived at the Cape of Good Hope. The voyage thence
to Natal only occupies three days. Immense enthusiasm
prevailed as each noble steamer and well-known regiment
arrived. The landing at D'Urban was performed in the
most expeditious manner, and without the slightest accident.
In the midst of all these arrivals and the excitement
connected with them, apprehensions of Zulu inroads were
at an end; but it was felt that the retrieval of the disaster
at Isandhlwana would be a serious work, and that energy
and ability were requisite to bring the war to a speedy and
satisfactory termination. The 12th of March was observed
throughout the colony of Natal as a day of humiliation,
and in every church prayers were offered up to the God
of battles, that He would bless our arms. The people of
Natal had, in proportion to their numbers, sent out a considerable
force across the Tugela. There was mourning
in many families for sons, brothers, husbands, slain at
Isandhlwana; and the losses caused to sugar estates and
other interests by the war were neither small nor unimportant.
The war was entirely an imperial act&mdash;levied by
the High Commissioner, and carried on in Zululand for
the protection of the Transvaal and of British South Africa
generally, as well as of Natal.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The colonists maligned.</i></div>

<p>When transport prices increased in accordance with the
inexorable laws of supply and demand, immense sums were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
obtained by waggoners as well as by owners of oxen and
waggons. Other classes also greatly benefited by the large
military expenditure. It stands to reason that very large
sums of money spent in South Africa must have permeated
through all classes of the community. At the same time,
it is incorrect to charge the people with special greed and
rapacity. They have been libelled by more than one
person; and with reference to various charges, the Rev.
Mr. de Witt, at an early stage of the war, publicly stated in
London that the people of Natal treated the Zulus worse
than dogs, while, at a subsequent period, Mr. Archibald
Forbes, correspondent of the <i>Daily News</i>, maligned them
in the most insulting manner. It is so well known as to be
beyond question that the Zulus are extremely well-treated&mdash;too
well-treated frequently&mdash;by the colonists; and to
those conversant with the subject, the missionary's statement
at once is seen in its true light, as a mere attempt
to obtain a little popularity by joining the usual successful
outcry against the oppression of coloured races by the
"cruel white men," so constantly echoed by people who
have never lived among blacks, and are perfectly ignorant
of the facts of the case. Philanthropy obtained at this
price, and by means of calumnies against our fellow-countrymen
at a distance and in a most trying position
of danger, cannot be estimated at a high price. Mr. Forbes
was so very short a time in Natal as to be perfectly incompetent
to judge of the entire character of the people.
His sweeping condemnations must be attributed to bad
temper, occasioned by petty inconveniences or rudeness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
but it is a pity that a man of his eminence and ability
should permit such considerations to affect his judgment
or guide his pen. The fact is that the people of the
colonies, and of Natal very especially, are, in proportion
to their number, quite superior to the people of Europe.
There is more education and more intelligence; consequently,
quite as much honesty. Let any man who is
really qualified to speak by a real knowledge of the colonies
say whether or not this is the truth. Of course, it must
be admitted that there is a greater spirit of independence
and more freedom, with less conventionality; but this is
merely a sequence of the circumstances in which colonists
are necessarily placed.</p>

<p>Intelligent and influential public writers in England
have gone so far as to assert that "it would not be safe
to rely on the energetic co-operation of the Cape." His
Excellency the Governor and High Commissioner thus
disposes of this subject:&mdash;"I fear that possibly, in the
press of work, I may have omitted to do justice to the
patriotic and energetic spirit shown by the Cape ministry,
who in this respect represent, I believe, very faithfully the
feeling of the colony generally.</p>

<p>"The Cape Government, indeed, appears to me to have
done all and much more than could have been expected
from it. It has spared a regiment and a half of her
Majesty's forces, taken its own recently subdued rebellious
districts entirely under its own charge, and is sending to
Natal very useful contingents of volunteers, native levies,
waggon drivers, supplies of arms, and means of transport
in mules, horses, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Public spirit at the Cape.</i></div>

<p>"The tone and spirit generally shown by the Cape
Government and people will naturally be compared with
that shown by the sister colony of Natal, whose interests
are so much greater; and without any reflection on Natal,
the population of which has risen to the occasion, the comparison
will be by no means unfavourable to the Cape.</p>

<p>"It must not be forgotten that the nearer we approach
the seat of war, actual or threatened, the greater will be
the natural disinclination of colonists to volunteer for any
but home service, and to leave their houses defenceless.
This is, I feel sure, the principal reason of any disinclination
to encourage volunteering for service in Zululand; and
the threatened disturbance in Basutoland will naturally
disincline the Cape colonists to weaken too far their own
means of defence."</p>

<p>The services of the navy during the entire war were
of the utmost value. In a despatch dated the 15th of
February, the High Commissioner brings specially to the
notice of her Majesty's Government the excellent service
performed by the naval brigades landed from H.M.S. <i>Active</i>
and <i>Tenedos</i> by Admiral Sullivan, and subsequently from
the <i>Boadicea</i>. These men, in arduous and prolonged
military operations, earned most thoroughly the title of
"bravest of the brave." No sailor ever turned his back
on an enemy during the war, and it was with difficulty
that their impetuous heroism could be checked. The <i>Active</i>
men helped to win the battle of Ineyezane, and were with
Colonel Pearson at Ekowe; Fort Tenedos was manned by
the men of the ship of that name. This important fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
commanded the crossing of the Tugela river near its mouth.
Men-of-war cruising on the coast produced an excellent
effect, but it is the services of the gallant "blue jackets" in
the field which are specially deserving of eulogium.</p>

<p>So soon as the news of the Isandhlwana disaster had
been received at St. Helena, Governor Janisch obtained the
consent of the military and naval authorities to send off at
once every available man to Natal. This was done with
promptitude. And the first real ray of sunshine from home
reached our troops in Zululand when they heard that 650
gallant men in H.M.S. <i>Shah</i>, Captain Bradshaw, had
arrived in Natal to assist them.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pni05">THE ZLOBANE MOUNTAIN&mdash;PIET UYS&mdash;THE BATTLE
OF KAMBULA&mdash;THE INTOMBE DISASTER&mdash;BATTLE OF
GHINGHELOVO&mdash;RELIEF OF EKOWE.</p>

<p class="pn p2">It is now necessary to refer to the operations of Colonel
Wood's column.</p>

<p>On the 27th of March a force started from the Kambula
camp to attack the Zlobane mountain, consisting of detachments
of the Frontier Light Horse, Raaff's Corps,
Weatherley's Rangers, Baker's Horse, Major Tremlett
with rocket tube, and the burgher force. The number of
horsemen was 400, and in addition a large body of the
Native Contingent was sent, under Major Leet, 1-13th, and
Lieutenant Williams, 58th Regiment. Another column
was despatched, consisting of mounted infantry, Kaffrarian
Mounted Rifles, and Wood's Irregulars, under Commandant
Schermbrucker. Colonel Wood, chief in command, and
staff followed. We will go with the first column under
Colonel Buller, which halted at noon on the south side of
the Zinquin neck. Colonel Weatherley, with his troopers,
arrived half an hour afterwards. As the column passed
the south side of the Zlobane mountain, two shots were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
fired from an elephant gun, and three fires were instantaneously
lit on a shelf of rock near the summit. Commandant
Uys, a brave Dutch burgher, who had already
frequently distinguished himself in the war, acted as guide,
and the march onward took place in perfect silence.
Moving forward in the stillness of death, the east side of the
mountain was reached. As the time of action approached,
the front post of danger and of honour was taken by Commandant
Uys, Colonel Buller, Majors Leet and Tremlett.
When 500 yards from the top, the enemy opened a furious
fire, in which Lieutenant Williams was killed; but our
gallant fellows pressed on without faltering for an instant,
and gained the top of the mountain, although the ascent
was extremely steep and trying. The fight continued at
this point for another hour, and during the entire time the
British force was exposed to a most galling fire from Zulus
stationed behind rocks and in caves. When Colonel
Wood was within 100 feet from the summit, Mr. Lloyd,
his interpreter, fell mortally wounded, and his own horse
was shot under him. Colonel Weatherley was desired to
dislodge one or two Zulus who were causing most of the
loss; but as his men did not advance rapidly, Captain
Campbell, Lieutenant Lysons, and three men of the 90th,
jumping over a low wall, ran forward and charged into a
cave, where Captain (the Hon. R.) Campbell, leading in
the most gallant and determined manner, was shot dead.
Lieutenant Lysons and Private Fowler followed closely
on his footsteps, and one of them, for each shot fired,
killed one Zulu and dislodged another, who crawled away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
by a subterraneous passage, reappearing higher up the
mountain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Zlobane mountain.</i></div>

<p>After silencing the fire of the Zulus at the top of the
Zlobane mountain, Colonel Buller and Commandant
Raaff rode to the westward end, where the track divides it.
The Zulus had fortified the pass with stone walls, and from
this position were annoying the rear of the attacking force.
In the mean time parties of Raaff's and Baker's Horse, and
the burgher force, kept up a hot fire on the enemy lurking
under the krantzes on the north-west side, where the
Zulu troops had built huts for encampment. After having
been four or five hours on the summit, Colonel Buller,
with Commandments Uys and Raaff, were returning from
silencing the enemy's fire at the pass, when they noticed
the arrival of a body of Zulus on the northern extremity
of the mountain. Colonel Buller rode off to attack them,
but before he could get half-way, he saw that troops of
natives were climbing every available baboon-path, with
the object of cutting off the retreat of our men from the
only two passes by which it was possible to descend. At
the same time, two great columns of the enemy were seen
approaching along the top of the mountain to the eastward,
and another dense mass of men advancing from the
southward. Colonel Buller then gave the order to ride for
the pass over the krantz at the neck, which was the only
exit left open. Then ensued a scene which almost defies
description. Down a descent fearfully steep and covered
with boulders horses were ridden at full speed. Many who
lost their steeds were saved on the cruppers of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
comrades. At the foot, Colonel Buller, with other officers,
did everything possible to rally sufficient men to cover the
retreat of those still descending, but every effort was in
vain. The retreat became a flight, and that even degenerated
into a species of stampede, panic guiding the
actions of the fugitives. It was when endeavouring to
descend the mountain that the brave Commandant Uys
was killed. He had already reached such a forward position
as to be comparatively free from danger, when he
learned that one of his sons was behind, and might probably
fall into the enemy's hands. He returned immediately, but
only to die. A ring of savages closed around him. True
to the traditions of his race, he fought bravely to the last,
and only succumbed to overwhelming force. He fell,
stabbed to death by numerous assegais. The family of
Piet Uys was celebrated in Kafir wars. He was born in
the Humansdorp district of the Cape Colony, and his
family left that neighbourhood for Natal in 1837. Both
his father and brother were killed fighting against Dingaan,
and he himself, determining to avenge their death, was
among the first to offer his services. In one of his letters
he writes, "I fight in a good faith and a righteous cause. I
must avenge the death of my father and brother, although
in doing so I am almost sure to lose my life; yet I cannot
restrain myself when I remember how they were slain."</p>

<p>A similar fate was reserved for the gallant Colonel
Weatherley. This officer, with his Rangers, delayed starting
in retreat, and lost his way. Nearly every man of his force
was cut off, while their brave leader, holding his son&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
boy of fourteen&mdash;to his breast, fought manfully, until he
fell pierced with numerous wounds.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Death of Uys and Weatherley.</i></div>

<p>Thus perished two of the most gallant officers who
served in the war&mdash;one of Dutch extraction, the other
an Englishman. The services of Commandant Uys were
of such great value, in consequence of his bravery and
thorough knowledge of the country, as to receive special
recognition, and no more gallant officer fought under the
British flag than poor Weatherley, of the Transvaal Rangers.</p>

<p>Among those killed at the Zlobane was a man named
Calverley, whose antecedents were of a very peculiar and
somewhat suspicious character. He had come as ambassador
from Oham, the brother of Cetywayo, by whom
he was evidently completely trusted. Shuffling and vacillation
characterized the negotiations, and it was noticed
in camp that Calverley rode the horse on which Lieutenant
Coghill was killed at Isandhlwana. He likewise possessed
property known to have been lost in that disaster. But for
strict military discipline, Calverley would undoubtedly have
been killed by our soldiers, and even after Oham came
over he was still treated with suspicion. On this day,
however, he expiated any faults he may have committed by
his blood, and died fighting in the British ranks against
the enemies of Oham and of England.</p>

<p>Colonel Wood was riding slowly under the Zlobane
mountain to the westward, perfectly unconscious of the
existence of a large Zulu force moving on the left across
his front. When about half-way, at the centre of the
mountain, one of the natives, named Umtanga, explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
by signs that a large Zulu army was close upon them.
From an adjacent hill they perceived that a great host was
marching towards them, disposed in five columns, with
horns and the usual dense "chest," in accordance with the
rule of formation for attack. An order was sent to Colonel
Russell, who was then ascending the western end of the
range, to move eastward and cover the movement of our
natives to the camp. At 7 p.m. Colonel Wood reached
camp. Intelligence came in that Captain Barton's party
were on foot about ten miles distant, and Colonel Buller at
once started in heavy rain, and was able by means of led
horses to bring in seven men, who were the sole survivors
of the Border Horse and of Captain Barton's party. Thus
terminated this disastrous affair, in which our loss amounted
to about 120 men, and in which the enemy gained additional
courage for the great attack on the camp so shortly to
follow.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Captain D'arcy's escape.</i></div>

<p>Captain D'Arcy, of Irregular Horse, thus briefly and
forcibly sums up his experience of Zlobane:&mdash;"Now to
give you a short account. Three hundred and fifty of the
mounted men had to take a very strong position, a hill
called the Zlobane. We got up there, driving the natives
back at every point, although they fought very well.
Williams was killed as we charged up the hill, the baron
on the top when he was in command of his troop; a Zulu
spotted him from a hole, right through his head. Barton
was sent down a hill with some of C Troop, and just as we
got down we saw about 20,000 Zulus below us, trying to
get between us and the camp. We at once crossed the hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to come down a most fearfully steep place; the Dutchmen
got to the place, rushed down, and bolted as hard as they
could go. My troop was leading, and Blaine, myself, and
Hutton got them to go quietly down the hill, which was
really a fearful place. I had, of course, to stop on the top
of the hill, as we were retreating; the Zulus all this time
were giving us awful pepper from Martini rifles. I saw, I
thought, all our men down, and then considered I had to
think of myself. I got half-way down, when a stone about
the size of a small piano came bounding down. I heard a
shout above, 'Look out below,' and down the beastly thing
came right on my horse's leg, cutting it right off. I at the
same time got knocked down the hill by another horse, and
was nearly squeezed to death. I had taken the bridle off,
and was about to take the saddle (I mean I was going up
the hill to take it off my horse), when I heard a scream;
I looked up, and saw the Zulus right in among the white
men, stabbing horses and men. I made a jump for it, and
got down somehow or other, and ran as hard as I could
with seventy rounds of ball cartridge, a carbine, revolver,
field-glass, and heavy boots. I went some 300 yards, when
a fellow called Francis got a horse for me, but no saddle or
bridle&mdash;a rein did for both; when one of the Frontier Light
Horse got wounded through the leg, and I had to jump off,
put him on my horse, and run again. Colonel Buller
saved my life by taking me up behind him on his horse;
then Blaine, who had been keeping the natives off in the
rear, saw me (as after I got my breath I got off the colonel's
horse), and he nearly cried when he met me, all the fellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
thinking I had been killed on the top of the hill. He
behaved as he always does, and stuck to me, and pulled
me through the second time. The third time a major in
the artillery, Tremlett by name, took me up behind. Our
men and officers all behaved well, but the other volunteers
were what Major Robinson would call a big rabble. We
lost ninety-three white men and a number of natives. The
Frontier Light Horse lost three officers and twenty-four
non-commissioned officers and men, and sixty-six horses.
Each of our men arrived in camp with another man behind
him."</p>

<p>The great Zulu army which nearly succeeded in encircling
Colonel Wood's mounted party at the Zlobane
mountain, was discerned from the Kambula camp at 9 a.m.
on the 29th of March. Flushed with the success of the
previous day, and depending on their vast number and
excellent organization, they had determined to sweep away
for ever the small white force which had entrenched itself in
their midst. For four hours the Zulu army continued to
advance at a slow pace, executing the man&oelig;uvres considered
necessary to surround Kambula. The left horn
was seen marching in the direction of Balter Spruit for
over three hours before the men of the right horn made
their appearance. About 1 p.m. the enemy began to make
a rapid advance to the right of the Kambula hill, facing
Blood river. It was then time to prepare. Orders were
given to eat dinners with haste. The alarm sounded, tents
were lowered, positions were taken up on and underneath
the waggons, boxes of ammunition were opened, and every
preparation for defence was promptly made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Zulu disaster at Kambula.</i></div>

<p>When the right horn of the Zulu army was within two
miles distance, a mounted party went out amidst hearty
cheers to give them battle. Having advanced and fired,
the enemy became too numerous, and our men retired,
drawing the Zulus after them, which was the real object of
this man&oelig;uvre. The right horn of the enemy's army then
commenced its attack in earnest, pressing on most bravely
in spite of a tremendous fire from the artillery, the 90th
Light Infantry, and the 1-13th. Shell ploughed their
ranks, but they re-formed and steadily came on. At last,
chiefly through the scathing fire of shot and shell from four
of our big guns, the movements of the enemy became
paralyzed, and a panic commenced. At the rear of the
laager a body of the Zulus had gained the top of the hill,
about 300 yards off, and kept up a galling fire upon the
men of the 13th Regiment. All, however, was soon over,
the Zulus wavered, hesitated, turned, and fled. Amidst
lusty cheers our men followed in pursuit. F and G Companies
of the 13th charged them down the ravine at the
point of the bayonet. Shrapnel, case shot, etc., continued
to pour from the field-pieces on the heavy masses of
disorganized Zulus. The cavalry for seven miles pursued
them, until it was too dark to see. Many were shot down
at distances of ten and fifteen yards, while hand-to-hand
encounters with the flying foe diversified the scene.</p>

<p>The strength of the Zulu army at Kambula exceeded
20,000, and their plan of battle was evidently to advance
the right horn of their army so as to entice our troops to
come out and attack it. The left horn would then have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
advanced up the ravine, and gaining the summit of the
hill, charge and take possession of the waggons, thus completely
surrounding our position. In fact, the Isandhlwana
tactics were to be repeated. Fortunately, however, the
lesson we learned there was not in vain, and Kambula
proved this to demonstration. The Native Contingent ran
away before the fight, but the Basutos stood steadily at
their posts and fought well. The flower of Cetywayo's
army, consisting of young unmarried men, was engaged in
this attack, and more than 1200 were slain. No fewer than
785 bodies of Zulus were buried in the immediate vicinity
of the camp. It is noteworthy that they had many kinds
of breechloaders&mdash;Martini, Snider, and Mitford's patterns
being all represented. It was a grand sight to see the great
moving mass of more than 20,000 Zulu warriors advancing
straight amidst a withering fire. They shouted out when
near the camp, "We are the boys from Isandhlwana," and
retreated under circumstances where no European forces in
the world could have advanced. The victory was specially
one of artillery. The first shot was fired at 1.25 p.m.,
and the last at 5.25 p.m. Three hundred and sixty-two
shells and eighty-six charges of canister were expended.
Many acts of gallantry were performed. Colonel Wood, as
usual, was pre-eminent. The bravery and coolness of
Captain Woodgate was the subject of admiration, while
Colonel Buller greatly added to the laurels he had so
deservedly earned in the retreat from the Zlobane mountain.
It was on the latter occasion that he six times risked
his life in carrying out of danger and saving six men who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
being unhorsed, must otherwise have fallen into the hands
of a remorseless and savage foe. Thirty killed and fifty
wounded was the loss on our side at the battle of Kambula.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Intombe.</i></div>

<p>A description of the repulse of the Zulus from Kambula
camp has been written by Commandant Schermbrucker,
and this is what he says:&mdash;"As soon as we saw them turning
their backs, I got all my Kaffrarians rapidly to mount
the horses already saddled, and shortly afterwards all the
mounted forces in camp were ready, and we raced helter-skelter
after the flying Zulus. I took the extreme right,
Colonel Buller led the centre, and Colonel Russell, with
mounted infantry, took the left. For fully seven miles I
chased two columns of the enemy, who tried to escape over
the Umvolozi, but I came beforehand and pushed them off
the road. They fairly ran like bucks; but I was after them
like the whirlwind, and shooting incessantly into the thick
column, which could not have been less than 5000 strong.
They became exhausted, and shooting them down would
have taken too much time; so we took the assegais from
the dead men, and rushed among the living ones, stabbing
them right and left, with fearful revenge for the misfortunes
of the 28th inst. No quarter was given."</p>

<p>On the 12th of March a very serious disaster occurred
at the Intombe river, where an escort of the 80th Regiment,
under Captain Moriarty, was laagered. That officer commanded
a party of 104 men convoying a train of eighteen
waggons variously loaded, <i>en route</i> from Derby to Luneberg.
The flooded state of the river caused detention for several
days. A small party under Lieutenant Harward was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
stationed on the other side. That officer heard a shot
fired at 4 a.m., and shortly afterwards was roused by an
alarm, and saw, when the fog lifted, a dense mass of Zulus,
about 4000 in number, extending across the valley and on
the point of surprising the camp on the other side of the
river. He immediately put his men, thirty-five in number,
under arms, and directed their fire on the flanks of the
enemy. With tremendous celerity, Captain Moriarty's
force was surprised and the camp taken. An immediate
retreat was made by Harward, but not before the awful
sight was witnessed of the enemy slaughtering our men
on the banks of the river and in the water. The Zulus
crossed and came on in dense masses. A hand-to-hand
fight ensued, and a vain attempt to rally was made; then,
finding re-formation impossible, Lieutenant Harward put
spurs to his horse and galloped into Luneberg. Forty-four
men were killed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Losses of the English.</i></div>

<p>An eye-witness, Mr. Josiah Sussons, says:&mdash;"I was in the
waggon, sleeping, and early in the morning I got up to see if
it was daylight, and saw the Kafirs swarming around within
twenty yards of me. The alarm was given, and Captain
Moriarty called out, 'Guards out.' I ran back to my waggon
to get my rifle (which belonged to No. 1 Company, Transvaal
Rifle Volunteers, of which corps I am a member), but
in the confusion of the bullets flying about me, I could not
get it out. I now found it so dangerous that I determined
to try to bolt, if I could, without remaining to take my
clothes. As I emerged from the waggon for the last time,
I heard Captain Moriarty cry out, 'Fire away, men; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
am done.' I then went to the adjoining waggon to call
Whittington (also a Pretoria man), and I told him the
niggers were around. He immediately came out and
jumped down, but was caught almost as soon as he got
to the ground, and assegaied. The poor fellow shrieked out,
but without avail, as no assistance was at hand. Seeing
that I was powerless to do anything, having no arms of
any kind, I ran down between the oxen, and made for the
river, which was about sixty yards off. I found the Zulus
shooting and stabbing the people in all directions. The
sight was a most horrifying one, and never to be forgotten.
I had to dodge about to save myself, and am surprised that
I managed to get through at all. As soon as I got to the
river, I jumped in and made a dive, as swimming was too
dangerous, the Zulus standing on the banks, and at the
edge of the river, as thick as thieves, throwing assegais
and aiming their guns wherever they saw a head. I came
up about the middle of the river, but the moment my head
was out, I saw several Zulus pointing their guns, and ready
to fire. I therefore dived again, and came out on the
other side. The river was very full at the time, and
a strong current running. In crossing I had torn off my
shirt, the only garment I possessed, and therefore when
I landed I was entirely in a state of nudity. I now found
that fighting was still going on on all sides of me, and that
it was almost impossible I could get any further, and in my
desperation I contemplated throwing myself in the water,
to be drowned peaceably, rather than suffer the death by
torture of many of those I saw around me. I, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
got into a courageous spirit again, and dashed off, keeping
as much out of the way of the enemy as I could. Several
shots were fired at me, and assegais were flying in all
directions, but somehow I happened to be fortunate and
got clear of the encampment. I made for Meyer's station
as fast as I could, and overtook one soldier on the road,
who was shot dead just as I got up to him. I overtook two
others shortly after, who were also shot. Getting further
on, I fell in with Sergeant Booth and about a dozen men,
who were keeping up a retreating fire, and fighting very
pluckily. I rested for a few minutes with them, during
which time I espied the Zulus coming round the hill to
intercept us. I informed Sergeant Booth of this, and he
kept up a steady fire upon them, and made the enemy
retire back into the hills. I cannot speak too highly of the
conduct of Sergeant Booth on this occasion; he fought most
pluckily, and lost four of his small band here. It was entirely
owing to their doing so well that any of us managed
to get through at all. The Zulus would have entirely
surrounded us, and not a soul could have escaped. Seventeen
leaders and drivers were killed altogether, amongst
them being Whittington, Campbell, and Goss. As I got
in camp, I met Major Tucker going out with his men to
the relief."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hair-breadth escape.</i></div>

<p>One of the most sensational events which occurred
during April at the head-quarters camp of the fourth
(Colonel Wood's) column, was the arrival there of a man
whose hairbreadth escapes enable us to realize that truth is
stranger than fiction. Captain Mayne Reid could scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
venture on imagining what our readers will find stated
below as sober fact. There may be exaggeration or colouring,
but in the main the narrative is correct. Mr. Rudolph,
landrost of Utrecht, when out scouting on the Zunguin Neck
with five men, encountered a party of forty Zulus, of whom
he killed four. He picked up about the same time a
Frenchman named Grandier, who had belonged to Colonel
Weatherley's troop of Border Horse, and was made prisoner
by the enemy when so many of his comrades fell at the
Zlobane mountain. The story was told to Colonel Wood
and the staff&mdash;Captain Maude taking notes, the substance
of which is as follows:&mdash;He (Grandier) was one of the very
few who succeeded in charging through the mass of Zulus
by whom they were beset in front and rear. He had got
on to fairly good ground, and had set a comrade on his
horse, he running by the side, when a Kafir caught him
by the leg, and he was immediately overpowered by
numbers and made prisoner. His captors took him to
Umbellini's kraal, on the south side of the Zlobane, about
half-way up. He saw that chief, who asked him where
Shepstone was, and who was the commander of the commando
to which he belonged. He was kept prisoner that
night in a kraal, and sent out the next morning to work
in the mealie fields. Soon after he was taken by two or
three mounted men to the middle of a big commando, all
of whom threatened him with death, while the chief,
Manymane, ordered him to be sent prisoner to Cetywayo.
He stopped one day after that at the Zlobane, starting the
next day for Ulundi in charge of four men riding, while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
was made to walk and carry their provisions. He was quite
naked, all his clothes having been taken from him. They
took four days to make the journey, arriving in the evening,
when a messenger was sent forward to announce their
coming to the king. He remained all that night and next
day tied in a field. On the following day, at noon, he was
taken to Cetywayo, where a half-caste Dutchman, with long
hair, translated. Cetywayo asked what the English wanted
coming in that way to his country. He asked after Oham,
where he was stopping, and said he would kill him and
Shepstone and everyone else, as he had plenty of men
to do the work. He was very particular to learn the name
of the commander of the Kambula column. After replying
to these questions, Grandier was removed in custody to a
kraal, where he was threatened and beaten with very little
respite, and for four days had nothing but mealies to eat.
Some messengers then came and reported to Cetywayo
that Umbellini and his brother had been killed in the
attack on Colonel Wood's camp. On this Cetywayo
ordered Grandier to be sent back to Umbellini's Kafirs, that
they might sacrifice him to the <i>manes</i> of their deceased
chief. He was sent back next day with a guard of two
Zulus, only one of whom had a gun, though plentifully
supplied with assegais. On the 13th, about noon, they
were resting, after a long tramp, and the Zulus being sleepy,
Grandier watched his opportunity, snatched an assegai,
and pinned one man to the earth; the other woke up in
a fright and ran for his life. Grandier then made off
in the direction of the camp, walking all night and steering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
a course by the stars, when this morning he was seen by
Mr. Rudolph's party and brought in, so crippled in the
feet that he is at present in hospital. He saw at Ulundi
a Portuguese, who makes guns for Cetywayo, and on the
morning of the 14th so large a force of Kafirs, driving
cattle, passed him that he was obliged to remain hid all
the morning to let them pass.</p>

<p class="p1">On Saturday, the 30th of March, a start was made at
daybreak, and the column halted within entrenchments for
the night at Inyoni river. The force advanced without
tents, and with only a blanket and waterproof sheet for
each man. On Sunday, the Amatekulu river was reached,
and here a considerable detention took place in consequence
of difficulty in crossing. On Tuesday the column
reached the hills which border the Inyezane valley, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
then a site was selected for an entrenched laager. On
this day mounted patrols and scouts of the enemy were
seen for the first time. News was then received that a
large force was marching down, and that an attack might
be expected at any moment. The famous Ginghelovo camp
was then constructed. It was made sufficiently large for
2000 cattle to be placed in the centre, trenches were dug,
and the waggons laced together according to the approved
method.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Camp at Ginghelovo.</i></div>

<p>About eight o'clock on Tuesday evening (2nd April), a
false alarm took place, but nothing further noteworthy
occurred until daybreak of the next day, when the mounted
natives and scouts were sent out. A little before 6 a.m.
(Wednesday, 3rd April) our men fell back shooting steadily,
and immediately after two large columns of the enemy
were seen coming down the Inyezane hills, while one came
round the left by the Amatekulu Bush, and another
smaller one from the direction of the old military kraal.
In ten minutes' time the camp was surrounded and the
attack commenced. The nature of the ground favoured
the enemy, who came up with a rush to a distance of 400
yards; then they scattered and obtained shelter in long
grass which grew about the camp. For one hour and a
half, a heavy fusillade was kept up from both sides, and as
the Gatlings, two 9-pounder guns, and the rocket tubes
were all in action, such a tremendous fire was poured into
the enemy as to prevent the possibility of their advancing.
Many of our men, firing from waggons and high positions,
were able to pick off Zulus with their rifles. This destructive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
fire evidently had a great effect upon the enemy.
At half past seven o'clock, the mounted men and those of
the Native Contingent went out amidst tremendous cheering,
and drove the Zulus before them from the long grass, and
continued the pursuit for a distance of four miles. Masses
of the enemy then clustered upon the hills, but dispersed
upon being shelled from the fort.</p>

<p>During the action, Lord Chelmsford and his staff went
round the trenches, encouraging the men, and telling them
to fire steadily and low. The general himself was not
mounted, but the members of his staff were. Colonel Crealock
received a wound in the arm, and lost a horse; a bullet
went through Lieutenant Milne's clothes; and Captain
Molyneux had two horses shot under him. No fewer than
773 dead bodies of the enemy were found within a distance
of 1000 yards from the fort.</p>

<p>A flying column was now formed, consisting of the 57th,
60th, and 91st regiments, with 100 of the Naval Brigade,
and a few of John Dunn's scouts. It ought to be mentioned
that Dunn had already performed excellent service, and was
attached to head-quarters as principal guide. The life of
this man had been a very peculiar one. Born of English
parents in the Cape Colony, he had been brought to Natal,
and early in life entered Zululand as a trader. Eventually,
he learned the language and adopted the manners and
habits of the savages. He was made an induna or chief,
acquired cattle, wives, and other property, and in many
respects became the right-hand councillor and adviser of
Cetywayo. This is the more remarkable as he had, previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to that monarch's accession, espoused the cause of his
brother. It is suspected that he made himself peculiarly
useful in supplying guns, and in this way gained much of
both his influence and his wealth. When war was declared
by Britain, he came over with his flocks, herds, and wives,
became the trusted adviser and guide of the general in
command, and was marked out for preferment and favour.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Meeting of Pearson and Chelmsford.</i></div>

<p>The flying column left at daybreak on Thursday, reached
the Inyezane at about eleven, and as the sun was setting
came in view of the large hill behind which lay Ekowe.
Colonel Pearson galloped out by the new road, with 500
of his men, and when he grasped the hand of Lord
Chelmsford felt like one called forth from a dungeon to
the cheerful light of the sun. The fort he had guarded
so well was relieved. Crushing anxiety and responsibility
were succeeded by thankful congratulations. The cloud
which hung around Ekowe had passed away.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="pni05">THE SERVICES OF NATIVE CONTINGENTS&mdash;LORD CHELMSFORD
AND SIR H. BULWER&mdash;REVIEW OF THE CAMPAIGN&mdash;DIFFICULTIES
OF TRANSPORT&mdash;IMMENSE
DELAY&mdash;BURYING THE DEAD AT ISANDHLWANA.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The Native Contingent, composed of loyal Zulus, although
a large force, turned out a comparatively useless one.
After the battle of Isandhlwana, Colonel Glynn reports (on
the 24th of January), "The whole of the Native Contingent
walked off this morning." The reasons for this conduct
are furnished elaborately in a minute of Sir H. Bulwer,
Lieutenant-Governor of Natal, dated the 29th of January.
These men had numerous complaints. On the night of the
23rd of January, whilst the European force at Rorke's
Drift was entrenched, the Native Contingent had no such
protection. The general and his staff leaving camp
exercised a depressing influence. Uncertainty existed
regarding their wives and families. These reasons, and
reasons such as these, were furnished as explanations for
their desertion. Sir Henry Bulwer had been always of
opinion that to do away with the native system of organization
for the purpose of substituting a regimental system
was one of very doubtful advisableness. Nevertheless, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
consented to give the men required, and no fewer than
7050 were sent into the field. Lord Chelmsford declared
that he had never been able to understand what the tribal
system was, and that as often as he had endeavoured to
obtain information he had been baffled by vague generalities
and oft-repeated laudations. So anxious, however,
were the commandants to carry out what they considered
the tribal system, that the companies were organized with
uneven strength, in order that men of different tribes
should be kept distinct. Sir Henry Bulwer believed that
each column should have had a Native Contingent, and
that these should have been led by officers who represented
the Lieutenant-Governor, or Supreme Chief. They would
have then moved and fought in accordance with their
customs. The general could not agree to this. The natives
must be divided into battalions 1000 strong, and into companies
100 strong. They were not to fight in their own
fashion, and European officers, who did not know their
language, were given commands among them. Dissatisfaction,
discontent, and inefficiency resulted in such a
manner that in all respects the large Native Contingent,
numbering more than 7000 men, was a failure.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bulwer and Chelmsford.</i></div>

<p>Later on, very serious differences of opinion arose between
Lord Chelmsford and Sir Henry Bulwer. In reply
to suggestions from the general, the Executive Council of
Natal decided, on the 1st of March, that&mdash;</p>

<p>"(<i>a.</i>) In the opinion of this Council the proposition
that raiding expeditions should be made into the Zulu
country by the natives of this colony is unadvisable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
adoption, as being an impolitic and undesirable system of
war, as being calculated to provoke retaliation, and as
tending to demoralize the people engaged in it.</p>

<p>"(<i>b.</i>) 1. That the proposition to call out every available
native in the colony is open to serious objections.</p>

<p>"2. That a large proportion of the able-bodied male
population has already been called out, and that this
Council considers it undesirable to press the power of the
Supreme Chief to a point that would probably cause serious
discontent amongst the natives.</p>

<p>"3. That all trading, commercial, and farming operations
would be thereby disorganized and ruinous consequences
would ensue, the natives forming practically the
only labouring portion of the population in the upper
districts of the colony.</p>

<p>"4. That the calling out of the whole able-bodied male
population would, in all probability, induce a panic, and be
attended with serious inconveniences."</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that very unfortunate differences of
opinion existed between the supreme military power and
the civil government of Natal. It certainly must be
admitted that, as a rule, the friendly Zulus of the colony
were of little good as fighting men in the campaign.
Whether or not the opposite would have been the case if
the dangerous experiment had been tried of allowing them
to fight with their own weapons and in their own fashion
is extremely doubtful. The tribal system, root and branch,
is a failure in Natal, and a constant source of danger and
anxiety. So soon, therefore, as by means of enlightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
statesmanship it can be completely broken up and destroyed,
the better for the protection and defence of the
colony, as well as for the cause of civilization and the
nation we are trying to civilize.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Correspondence.</i></div>

<p>On the 11th of April, the general, writing to the Secretary
of State for War, says, "My orders regarding demonstrations
were fully carried out, but the fullness of the
Tugela would have prevented any general raid being made,
even if the Natal natives had not been forbidden to cross the
border by his Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor of Natal."
In order to enable my readers to understand the entire
question fully, I subjoin that portion of Sir Henry Bulwer's
despatch to the Secretary of State (April 16) which refers
to the subject. He says, "I have placed under the command
of the lieutenant-general, for service in the Zulu
country, the Natal Mounted Police, most of the Natal
Mounted Volunteers, a number of natives who have been
formed into what is called the Natal Native Contingent, and
a number of natives for pioneer, transport, and hospital
service, and that I have never interfered with them, nor
have I expected that the lieutenant-general's orders to them
should be referred to me before being complied with; but
with regard to the native levies, which have been called
out for the defence of the colony, and placed under the
command of colonial district commanders to protect the
border and the colony, I have never placed them in any
way, directly or indirectly, under the command of the
lieutenant-general for service in the Zulu country, nor have
I authorized, directly or indirectly, in any way, their being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
taken across the border, or their being employed in
making raids into the Zulu country. These levies
were called out expressly and solely for service in the
colony and for the defence of the colony, and were placed
under the colonial district commanders for that purpose
only. The colonial district commanders were, of course,
made subject, so far as regarded the defence of their districts,
and the movement and disposition of any forces
under them in their districts, to the military command;
but no authority has been given, either to these colonial
district commanders or to the lieutenant-general, to employ
the native levies, which were exclusively called out for the
defence of the colony, on any service in the Zulu country,
and I submit that the lieutenant-general in issuing any instructions
for these native levies to cross the border to
make raids into Zulu country, in issuing these instructions
as he has done, without my authority, without my concurrence,
and positively without any reference to me, has
exceeded his powers and acted without a due regard for
the authority of this Government.</p>

<p>"I pass by the question of the expediency or policy of
making raids into the Zulu country. In a letter addressed
by me to the High Commissioner, I have ventured to put
before his Excellency for his consideration the question of
the expediency of such a policy, and the risks involved in
such a course, namely, the risk of retaliation, and the risk
of irritating and alienating unnecessarily those of the Zulu
people who might otherwise be disposed to come to friendly
terms with us, and through whose friendly disposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
towards us a satisfactory solution of the difficulties between
us and the Zulu people might eventually be more easily
arrived at. But I do not claim to have any authority in
respect of this question, and I have done no more than
venture to lay my suggestion before the High Commissioner,
and to forward a copy of my letter to the lieutenant-general.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Native levies.</i></div>

<p>"With regard to the employment of the native levies
who had been called up for the defence of the border on
service beyond the border and in making raids, I have
already shown that the levies to which I refer were never
in any way placed under the lieutenant-general for employment
across the border; and I have also shown that they
were levies which have nothing whatsoever to do with the
Native Contingent battalions to which the lieutenant-general
refers as having been hitherto associated with the British
troops, and which were placed under his command for
service across the border. The question, therefore, put by
the lieutenant-general, in the way that it is put before the
Secretary of State for War, by not distinguishing between
the two descriptions of native forces, but, as is actually
done in the last paragraph but one, by naming and associating
the two together as if there were no distinction
between them, fails, I think, to represent the real state of
the case."</p>

<p>The general in command had felt extremely what he
considered the absence of co-operation on the part of Sir
Henry Bulwer. Writing to the Secretary of State for War
on the 11th of April, Lord Chelmsford mentions that when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
he had determined to move up to Ekowe, secret instructions
were sent to the different commanders along the border
from the Lower Tugela up to Kambula hill, requesting them
to make strong demonstrations all along the line, and,
if possible, to raid into Zululand. At this juncture the
Lieutenant-Governor forbade the Natal natives to cross.
A general raid into Zululand effected by a large body of
native troops would, in the opinion of Lord Chelmsford,
have produced very important results, and the general
strongly resents the interference of Sir H. Bulwer with
his plans. The quarrel&mdash;for it was nothing less&mdash;to which
allusion has now been made, was very probably one of the
reasons for the appointment of Sir Garnet Wolseley, who
in his own person united both supreme civil and supreme
military power.</p>

<p>In the Zulu war there were two campaigns&mdash;the first
ended in Isandhlwana, the second at Ulundi. Between
these battles there was an immense interval, chiefly
occupied in moving great masses of men and greater
masses of supplies to the front. Lord Chelmsford is
blamed for want of foresight and care in the first campaign,
want of energy and judgment in the second campaign, and
want of generalship in both. There are two sides to the
case, and it is necessary to advert to both. Great difficulties
were in the way; but until the arrival of Sir Garnet
Wolseley and the joyful day of Ulundi, it must be admitted
that the general did not conquer obstacles, but obstacles
conquered him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Review of the campaign.</i></div>

<p>Let us endeavour to view the general conduct of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
campaign in the light of facts about which there can be no
question. Early in January Lord Chelmsford was at the
head of an army sufficiently numerous and powerful for the
conquest of Zululand. We shall see that at Ulundi 4000
soldiers, properly handled, were adequate to the complete
defeat of 20,000 Zulus, comprising the flower of Cetywayo's
army; therefore it is absurd to imagine that, if good
generalship had been used, any defeat could have been
sustained in the first advance. Colonel Pearson was
thoroughly victorious at Inyezane, and Colonel Wood was
also successful. Disastrous failure, however, overtook the
column of the general-in-chief. Lord Chelmsford, conducting
a large force with enormous stores, made Rorke's
Drift on the Tugela his base of operations, and subsequently
was forced to trust to the extraordinary efforts of a young
Engineer officer for the safety of Natal. All experience of
Zulu warfare had shown the absolute necessity of entrenchments,
yet the central column marched into Zululand
without constructing a single breastwork. The personal
safety of the commander-in-chief and that of half his
column became really due to a sudden inspiration and to
a happy accident. Young subalterns conceived and carried
a plan of defence where mealie-bags formed the breastworks
and biscuit-boxes the entrenchments. It was
providential that such officers as Chard and Bromhead
were there to do the work.</p>

<p>Lord Chelmsford was woefully deficient in knowledge of
the enemy's movements. An immense army lay in wait
to destroy his camp while he, with scattered forces, pursued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
a Will-o'-the-wisp foe which found no difficulty in luring
him on to destruction. He had mounted men, but does
not seem to have used them efficiently as scouts. Colonel
Buller, the able head of his intelligence branch, was in quite
another part of the country. Lord Chelmsford either completely
despised the enemy, which was a blunder in itself,
or he was incapable of appreciating his real position, and of
taking the evident means of preserving the column under
his charge. He evidently wanted that genius or instinct
so absolutely necessary to constitute a great military leader.
A really great general, like a poet, is born, not made; and
it was the misfortune of the British army not to have
secured one on this important occasion.</p>

<p>No entrenchment or laager was either made or ordered
to be made at Isandhlwana, although it must be admitted
that if the general had been as lucky in subordinates there
as at Rorke's Drift, a very different issue of the day would
have been the result. Nothing could surpass the madness
of Colonel Durnford in scattering his troops at the very
moment when, by means of laagering, or at least forming a
hollow square, it would have been possible to resist the
attack of the enemy. It is a libel on our soldiers to hint
that they did not behave well. The short service system
is in no way responsible for the disaster. The gallant
24th, as well as the other troops, fought with the utmost
bravery, and, if they had been commanded by such a man
as Wood or Pearson, undoubtedly would have gained a
brilliant victory. A few hundred Dutchmen, without breech-loading
guns, had behind a rough fortification of waggons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
defied an entire Zulu army. Chard and Bromhead, with
100 infantry soldiers, at the back of mealie-bags and
biscuit-boxes, were able to drive back immensely superior
forces. It is therefore preposterous to imagine that our
troops at Isandhlwana, assisted by well-served large guns,
could not easily, if properly commanded, have been able
to hold their own, at least until the rest of the column
arrived.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lord Chelmsford criticised.</i></div>

<p>In ten days' time Lord Chelmsford was so unfortunate
as to sustain a most signal defeat, in which half his force
was literally butchered, and his large quantity of ammunition
and stores captured by the enemy. His flank was
turned and his column surprised by an army of naked
savages, without artillery, about whose movements his
ignorance was as profound as it was surprising. A similar
success to that gained by Colonel Pearson would have
virtually concluded the war. A march to Ulundi by a
strong flying column would have been possible, and Great
Britain might then have saved the blood of many of her
best soldiers, and fully three million pounds sterling of
her treasure.</p>

<p>The opinions now expressed are those of the majority
of military correspondents and military men, but the
thorough novelty and difficulty of operations do not seem
sufficiently taken into account. Besides, in judging Lord
Chelmsford, it must be specially remembered that his
instructions about concentrating at Isandhlwana camp
were not attended to, and to this fact many attributed
the disaster that ensued. Certainly no one deserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
sympathy more than this general, whose misfortunes were
quite as great as his faults. Subsequently, he did everything
in his power to make the campaign successful.
Reinforcements poured in, and were pushed forward to the
front. It is true that delays occurred, but these, it is
argued, were thoroughly unsurmountable. We shall find
at last that Lord Chelmsford finished the campaign with
glory and success at the great battle of Ulundi. The
people of Natal and the Cape Colony, who had sympathized
with his reverses, thoroughly recognized the greatness of
this victory and rejoiced in his triumph. It is only fair,
when furnishing opinions full of condemnation, to refer
at the same time to the fact that contrary views are held
by numerous men of intelligence, who have had every
opportunity of studying the subject.</p>

<p>The disaster of Isandhlwana was pregnant with results
almost too awful to contemplate. Natal was panic-stricken.
Twenty thousand white people were threatened, not only
with the victorious army, but with hundreds of thousands
of natives, kept heathen and alien from motives of policy,
who would have, out of fear of Cetywayo, quickly joined
any army of massacre which that tyrant could have sent
to devastate Natal. Fortunately, in spite of their much-vaunted
strategy, the Zulus proved unequal to the task
of taking advantage of their victory. Had they, in the first
instance, only allowed the general to move forward into his
new camp, the destruction of the column could have been
made complete. It was by a miracle that Lord Chelmsford
and the men with him escaped. If they had been attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
when, exhausted and dispirited, they flung themselves down
on the reeking plain of Isandhlwana, it is extremely likely
that the general and every man with him would have been
killed. The gross absurdity of blaming Lord Chelmsford
for not burying the dead on the field is only equalled by its
injustice. The general and the remnant of his column were
really fugitives, and it was not until they found that, by
the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift, the base of operations
was still held, that they were able to breathe with any
degree of safety. It was hoping against hope to imagine
that a place really left unfortified could have been held
against a victorious army; and it is well to recognize the
fact that not only Natal and its people, but Lord Chelmsford
and the remnant of his column, were saved by the
heroes of this colonial Thermopylæ.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Panic in Natal.</i></div>

<p>The awful pause of suspense, which lasted many weeks,
passed by. The Tugela river and the indecision of the
Zulu king saved the colony. Reinforcements which had
been telegraphed for poured in with amazing celerity, and
both Natal and British honour were saved. For nine
weeks the beleaguered column under General Pearson had
to suffer privations, and the Zulus, who had experienced
what British soldiers could do behind biscuit-boxes at
Rorke's Drift, hesitated to attack them when behind regular
entrenchments at Ekowe. At last, as we had seen, relief
was sent. Then another period of delay set in. Masses
of troops continued to arrive, and early in May our strength
in Natal comprised more than 22,000 men, divided as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The transport difficulty.</i></div>

<p class="p1">This was a large army, the most powerful force of Europeans
ever engaged in war within South Africa. The
occasion was supreme, as the greatest power of the native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
races had challenged the white man to a combat <i>à l'outrance</i>,
and the question simply was whether the Queen or Cetywayo
should rule supreme in the southern portion of this
continent. Reinforcements were sent out with immense
celerity, and landed with the utmost despatch and with
neither casualty nor danger. But the delay in moving them
was most disappointing. It must have puzzled the Zulus
immensely to understand why we were so extraordinarily
slow. Five weeks had elapsed since the battle of Ginghelovo
without any set engagement with the enemy taking
place, and the Press began to grumble. Transport rose to
unprecedented rates. Twenty shillings per cwt., or £20 per
ton, was charged for the carriage of provisions a distance
of fifty-four miles, from D'Urban to Pietermaritzburg.
Oxen died in hundreds, and the progress of the battalions
of infantry which were marching against an enemy famous
for their celerity was most disheartening. The plan of
Lord Chelmsford was that of sending on masses of troops,
whose <i>impedimenta</i> in the shape of baggage and means of
supply was so enormous as to completely cripple their
movements. At a subsequent period, after the arrival of
Sir Garnet Wolseley, we shall find that officer successfully
employing more than 2000 Zulu carriers; but this method,
cheap and efficient, does not seem to have been tried by
Lord Chelmsford.</p>

<p>To lessen the enormous difficulties of transport, which
crushed the efforts of our soldiers, a successful attempt was
made to find a landing-place on the Zululand coast. H.M.
gunboat <i>Forester</i> was sent on this quest, which was ultimately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
successful, and Port Durnford was established as a
place for landing supplies. This cut off more than a hundred
miles of difficult road, and was of immense service to
the advancing columns. During May, 1879, the <i>Forester</i><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
performed important duties in this service, and more than
once fired at bands of the enemy near the seashore.</p>

<p>It is impossible to write any chronicle of the movements
of General Crealock's column which would be of interest.
It crawled along among hundreds of dead oxen killed in
dragging its heavy baggage and supplies over bad roads.
Enormous expenditure for commissariat and transport services
went on, and it was very evident that this war would
be waged at frightful cost. The British lion growled in
England, and there was an undoubted echo in the colonies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Position of the forces.</i></div>

<p>On the 15th of May, the head-quarters of the South
African field force, under Major-General Newdigate, was
situated on the Buffalo river, near Doornberg. The force
comprised:&mdash;Right wing of the 17th Lancers; three companies
1-21st Regiment; six companies 58th; N battery,
5th Brigade, Royal Artillery, with six 7-pounders, under
Colonel Harness; N Battery, 6th Brigade, with six
9-pounders; Army Service Corps, Army Hospital Corps,
Bengaugh's Native Battalion, Natal Pioneers, and Natal
Carbineers. Colonel Tatton Browne commanded the Royal
Artillery, and Captain Anstey the Royal Engineers. Twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
miles further on, at Conference Hill, was the most advanced
post, where Colonel Davies, Grenadier Guards, commanded.
The garrison was composed of six companies of the 94th
Regiment, Bettington's troop of Natal Horse, a detachment
of the Royal Engineers, and Shepstone's Mounted Basutos.
Another fort and laager had been erected for their defence,
while eight miles further on towards the north-east was
Brigadier-General Wood's new camp at Magwechana, close
to the Sand Spruit, one of the sources of the White
Umvolosi. General Marshall was with the cavalry camp.
The experience of Isandhlwana was thoroughly sufficient,
and the most complete precautions on all occasions were
taken to prevent the possibility of disaster. Forts and
fortified positions covered the country, but, nevertheless,
there is excellent authority for saying that if a Zulu impi
had been ordered to invade, there would have been no difficulty
in driving back the weak border guard which lined the
Tugela, getting behind the regular forces, and making a
rapid destructive raid and an equally rapid retreat.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Cetywayo's
neglect of his opportunities was more useful in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
protecting Natal than the immense armed force which, with
infinite toil and a slowness almost passing description,
moved on towards Ulundi. Loud were the public outcries
at the transport break-down and the tardiness of operations.
General Newdigate's magnificent force seemed paralyzed,
and the difficulties of grass for horses and supplies
for troops <i>en route</i> was the theme of every journal and the
excuse for a delay which was as costly as it was disappointing.</p>

<p>On the 17th of May, a road was made in the direction of
Landman's Drift, and a few days afterwards all the cavalry
proceeded to Rorke's Drift, and thence to Isandhlwana,
for the purpose of burying the dead. It was certainly
full time to perform this duty. One of the disgraceful
occurrences or sad consequences of the Zulu war is the
fact, which cannot be slurred over without comment, that
the bodies of our brave men who fell at Isandhlwana
remained unburied for more than four months. Two regiments
of Dragoon Guards, with the Lancers and numerous
other troops, moved on with alacrity to perform the honourable
task. The force advanced in line, <i>échelon</i>, or column
of squadrons, with extensive advance and rear guards, as
well as flankers. At night the men bivouacked in groups
of twelve, with their saddles turned inwards and placed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
a circle. At last they looked down from the Biggarsberg
upon Rorke's Drift and the Isandhlwana mountain in the
distance. One regiment of the Lancers and one of the
Dragoon Guards, as well as half the Natal Carbineers,
swept the country in the neighbourhood. The smoke of
blazing huts rose up like burnt-offerings from the hill-altars
of Zululand. The signal-fires of the savages helped to
light up the country at night, and the British were again
on the field where Cetywayo had gained his first and last
victory. General Marshall, with Dragoons, Lancers, irregular
horse, police, and artillery, crossed the river at
daybreak, and advanced in open order. But my readers
will prefer to read an account of what was seen and done
at Isandhlwana from the pen of a soldier who was there.
The correspondent of the <i>Times</i> of Natal writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Troops marching.</i></div>

<p>"We pushed on very steadily and carefully, and at
half-past nine our advance-guard was on the ridge overlooking
the valley beyond Isandhlwana. There it lay,
a magnificent stretch of country, with undulating plains
for miles, only broken by dongas and small rises, and
bordered by high hills on each side. Who would have
thought, looking down on the quiet scene, that it had
witnessed one of the most terrific fights and disasters of
modern times? The grass had grown up over the whole
site of what had once been our camp, and was thickly
intermixed with mealie stalks and oat hay, green and
growing yet. Among these lay the bodies of our poor
soldiers, scattered about in all postures, and in all stages
of decay; while the positions of our tents were indicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
by the broken remains of boxes, trunks, tins of preserved
meats, remnants of the tents themselves, and masses
of disordered papers, books, and letters, etc., etc. The
only thing, however, that at once drew the attention of
a casual observer was the broken remains of waggons and
the skeletons of horses and oxen. Everything else was
hidden at first sight, and required searching for to be
noticed. One thing we had observed coming along the
road was the fresh spoor of a waggon or two, and we conjectured
that it had been recently used in conveying crops
from Sirayo's valley away into the strongholds further
inland. The spoor of two mounted Kafirs, and one on
foot, was also traced by the scouts fresh that morning;
one of the horses was shod all round, and these men were
evidently of the party left by the enemy to watch the
coming of our troops. For some time after our arrival,
and while preparations were being actively carried out
to harness the horses to the best waggons, all the men except
those on vedette or other duty were allowed to wander
over the scene of the disaster. The Carbineers, under
Captain Shepstone, made immediately for their camp, and
tried to find any relics of their dead brethren. Nothing of
any consequence was, however, found near their lines; but
upon searching over the ground where the bodies of some
of them had been seen on the night after Isandhlwana,
Captain Shepstone came upon the bodies of Colonel
Durnford, Lieutenant Scott, and nearly all the Carbineers,
except London and Bullock, and those few who were killed
along the fugitive path. Poor Durnford was easily recognizable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and he had on his mess waistcoat, from the pocket
of which Shepstone took a small pocket-knife with his name
on it. Two rings were also taken, and are with the knife
to be sent home <i>in memoriam</i> to the colonel's father.
Durrant Scott lay partially hidden under a broken piece
of a waggon, and had evidently not been mutilated or
touched after his death. He had his patrol jacket on,
buttoned across, and although the rest of the body was
only a skeleton, yet, strange to say, the face was like in
life, all the hair being still on, and the skin strangely
parched and dried up, although perfect. Both these
bodies lay right in the midst of the rest of the young
colonists who fell gallantly in defence of their country; and,
judging from the position in which they all were, they
must have made one last gallant stand, and have been
killed altogether. None of these so found had attempted
to run, but had stuck together in life as we found them
in death. Knowing all of them well, and how they did
their duty, I felt it almost impossible to examine any, and
had to leave the scene for another one. I can only add
that Durnford's body was wrapped in canvas and buried
in a kind of waterwash, while all the others were covered
over with stones, etc., and their names written in pencil on
wood or a stone close by them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Isandhlwana revisited.</i></div>

<p>"The bodies of the Royal Artillery and Natal Mounted
Police were also buried, the only ones left untouched being
those of the 24th Regiment, which was done at the express
desire of Colonel Glyn and the officers, in the hope of their
being able some day to do it themselves. This appeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
however, very strange to us, and many remarks were made
about the seeming dishonour to part of our brave dead.
However, let us hope that some day, not far distant, we
may be able to return to that once blood-red field and bury
all the bodies, bones, and relics that may be left. Great
numbers of waggons have undoubtedly been taken away,
as also everything of value in the camp, and many bodies
have been, through one cause or another, either wholly
or partially removed or disturbed, so as to effectually
prevent recognition. I myself did not move far out of
camp, and, therefore, may be a bad judge, but from what
I saw there cannot have been more than 200 bodies in the
camp itself, and out of these not 25 Kafirs. Doubtless,
had I gone out to where the fighting first commenced,
I should have found many more bodies, but I am glad for
my own sake that I did not do so. Others, who had not
perhaps so many bitter feelings or sorrowful remembrances
of those lying around us, went further and saw more,
although I cannot hear of any one having recognized any
more bodies of officers, except those of the Hon. S. Vereker
and young Gibson, both lieutenants in the Native Contingent.
Many interesting relics were found and brought
away by others, and I know of a few cases where letters
addressed to relatives at home from those among the killed
were found complete, and will be sent home, to be held
in loving regard by the living, but will cause many sores
scarce healed to be reopened. The general was anxious,
for more reasons than one, to get away, and therefore,
as soon as the waggons were ready, we made a start back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
at twelve, and reached Rorke's Drift at half-past three
without any hitch whatever. Immediately on getting back
I went inquiring among the different parties who had been
over that day, and gleaned some other interesting facts
from them. One officer in the Dragoon Guards, while out
with his squadron burning kraals, found in one signs of
very recent occupation, and the staff of the Queen's colour
of the 1-24th. He also later on came across a kraal full of
skeletons of Zulus; and this fact, taken in conjunction with
the finding of large graves on the left of our camp containing
bodies of the enemy, goes far to prove that the
Zulus did move their dead bodies, and as the kraal was
some two miles off where skeletons were found, they probably
also moved them in our waggons. The forty
waggons we brought away included two water carts in
good preservation, one gun limber, a rocket battery cart,
and three Scotch carts. All that we left behind, in number
not more than twenty, were in a partially or entirely disabled
condition. Counting all these, therefore, there are
still sixty or seventy waggons missing, which have been
taken away at different times."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Kaffrarian riflemen.</i></div>

<p>The irregular horse recruited in the Cape Colony and
Natal deserve special mention. Their services during the
war were of a most important and valuable character.
Most of them were attached to General Wood's column,
and in the many daring raids in which their services were
used proved excellent soldiers. Among the most prominent
of these corps was that of the Kaffrarian Riflemen, under
Commandant Schermbrucker. On the 30th of April, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Utrecht, on the occasion of the expiry of their engagement,
that officer bade farewell to his officers and men in an eloquent
address in which he recalled their principal services.
Six months previously, on a public parade at Pietermaritzburg,
they had been selected by Lord Chelmsford for a
post of danger, in consequence of the manner in which they
had fought on the borders of the Cape Colony during the
Gaika rebellion. For nearly three months the important
and dangerous post of Luneberg had been held, and the
handful of white men had inflicted serious losses on the
enemy, and secured safe communication <i>viâ</i> Intombe to
Derby. They had been attached to "that glorious column"
commanded by Evelyn Wood, and formed part of the forces
under Buller engaged in the rescue of Oham's people at
his surrender. They were also in the disastrous storming
of the Zlobane and the glorious battle of Kambula.
Admirable obedience and cheerful discipline were maintained
in the face of 20,000 enemies. Their last duties
were the harassing ones of escorting convoys <i>en route</i>
from Batlee Spruit to Kambula.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> What was said, and said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
truly, of Schermbrucker's Irregular Horse might be said with
little variation of the other corps&mdash;Baker's, Whalley's, etc.
Colonial men, such as Schermbrucker, Nettleton, Shepstone,
Lonsdale, Blaine, Pickering, Wilson, and many others,
distinguished themselves in the field, and it can be said
with equal truth and justice that the volunteer force and
levies, officers and men, proved most valuable auxiliaries.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Transvaal again.</i></div>

<p>The Transvaal Republic had dragged along a sad existence
for many years, troubled constantly by native incursions
from without, and debt, quarrelling, and discontent
from within, when the Rev. Thomas F. Burgers was
elected President in the year 1872. He was to revolutionize
the entire country, and to make a new and improved
Holland in Southern Africa. Gifted with certain talents,
among which that of oratory was conspicuous, Burgers
was deplorably deficient in a knowledge of men and business.
His plans were utopian, visionary, and unsound. He
caused hundreds of Boers to leave their adopted country,
by forcing on them a system of education from which the
teachings of religion were excluded; contracted a loan of
£300,000 for a railway from Delagoa Bay, which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
have cost millions; designed a fanciful coat of arms and flag;
caused gold coins to be issued with his own likeness
stamped upon them, and played such "fantastic tricks before
high heaven" as to help forward that crisis of bankruptcy
and ruin from which it would have been very difficult, even
by an exactly opposite course, to have saved the country.</p>

<p>During the absence of the President in Europe, in 1875,
Sekukuni, the principal chief of the Bapedi people, broke
out in rebellion. In April, 1876, he was called upon to
submit, but in place of doing so boldly claimed the larger
portion of the Lydenburg and Pretoria districts. A commando
then marched against him, and succeeded in taking
"Mathebi's Kop," which was grandiloquently styled the
Gibraltar of South Africa. A subsequent attack upon
Sekukuni's head kraal was a failure. The prosecution of
the war was then entrusted to volunteers, and after a short
time an inglorious peace was concluded. This treaty was
only made to be broken, as it was repudiated and treated
with contempt by Sekukuni.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Annexation, history of.</i></div>

<p>The peace of all British South Africa was seriously
jeopardized by the weakness and fatuity of the Government
of the Transvaal Republic. They were unable to conquer
Sekukuni, and were so threatened by Cetywayo as to make
an incursion by that potentate exceedingly probable. If
the outworks of civilization were not looked after there
would soon be serious danger to the fortress. Sir Theophilus
Shepstone was therefore appointed special Commissioner.
He arrived at Pretoria in January, 1877, and an
extraordinary session of the Volksraad was held in February.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
A radical reform, legislative, executive, and judicial, or the
British flag, was the alternative laid before them. They
chose the former, but remedies then came too late. The
patient was incurable. President Burgers declared that
a new constitution could not save them. On the 8th of
March the Raad broke up, and on the 12th of April Sir
Theophilus Shepstone formally annexed the Transvaal
territory to the British crown. It was, without doubt, incomparably
the best course for a bankrupt country, perfectly
unable to cope either with its debts or its foes, but it is
very doubtful whether it was the wisest course for the
British Government. An immense burden was at once
placed upon our shoulders, and the people furnished with
a grievance easily fanned into discontent, and perhaps
even into rebellion, by Hollanders and others who could
make capital out of factious opposition and a trade out
of revolution. If Sir Theophilus Shepstone had only
waited long enough, the people would have begged upon
their knees for protection and assistance when attacked
by the enormous armies of the Zulu king. If we had
intervened in such a crisis, we would have obtained
the assistance&mdash;valuable assistance&mdash;of thousands of
mounted burghers; whereas, when we did fight really for
the Transvaal, its inhabitants were so disgusted with what
had transpired, as to render almost no assistance. There
is no doubt that we managed the annexation of this country
badly, and have been compelled to suffer for it. By a
policy of delay, which would certainly have been less kind
but incomparably more wise, the people would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
forced to come as suppliants for protection and annexation.
Their lives and property when threatened by Cetywayo,
could have alone been saved by British intervention.
It can certainly be argued, on the other side, that delay was
particularly dangerous, and that if we had not at once
established ourselves in the Transvaal, the Zulus would
have lighted a fire which would have spread quickly throughout
every native tribe, and have endangered the peace of
all our settlements. Sir Theophilus Shepstone was in an
excellent position to judge of the necessity, and her
Majesty's Government has uniformly upheld the policy
adopted by him in annexing the Transvaal.</p>

<p>Sekukuni had proved a thorn in the side of the Republic
which they had really been unable to get rid of. The peace
with this chief was quite illusory, and only betrayed weakness
on the part of the Dutch. We cannot be surprised,
therefore, that he soon resumed hostilities. Under British
rule an expedition was, in 1878, sent against him, consisting
of volunteers and native police, under the command of
Captain Clark. This force was not strong enough, and
portions of the 13th and 80th Regiments, together with
mounted infantry and volunteers, were despatched under
Colonel Rowland. An unprecedented drought rendered
operations almost impossible, and the expedition had to
return, after leaving a portion of the 80th Regiment to
guard the passes. The great war with Cetywayo soon
absorbed all our attention and efforts, therefore the attack
on Sekukuni in his stronghold was postponed. It was
reserved for Sir Garnet Wolseley to complete, late in 1879,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
that which had been commenced previous to the close of
1878. The rebellion of this native chief was specially one
against the Republic of the Transvaal, and we had to take
it over among the other heavy liabilities of that State.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Discontent of the Boers.</i></div>

<p>Sir Bartle Frere found it desirable to proceed to Natal
early in 1879, and remained there during the crisis which
resulted from the Isandhlwana disaster. On his return
the High Commissioner passed through the Transvaal, and
found that grumbling and discontent had been fomented
into incipient rebellion. Mass meetings of the farmers
were held, a people's committee was appointed, and a
determination to recover their independence was freely
expressed. With perfect firmness and straightforwardness,
accompanied by admirable tact and patience, Sir Bartle
Frere pointed out the real position of affairs. Another
petition to the Imperial Government for restoration of
their independence was sent through the High Commissioner,
and in this way the outbreak of feeling was calmed
for the time. Special envoys had been previously sent in
vain to gain this object, and it really seemed hoping against
hope to imagine that the Imperial Government could again
allow the re-establishment of such a republic as that which
had been found unable either to defend or govern the
people whom it was supposed to rule.</p>

<p class="pn p2">So far back as the 9th of February, Lord Chelmsford had
written to the Home Government, requesting that an
officer of the rank of major-general should be sent out at
once. Sir Bartle Frere concurred in that representation,
and suggested that the officer selected should be fitted to
succeed him in the position of High Commissioner. On
the 19th of March, the Secretary of State blamed Sir Bartle
Frere for not having afforded her Majesty's Government
an opportunity of considering the time as well as the
manner of coming to issue&mdash;should it be necessary to come
to issue&mdash;with the Zulu king. Sir Michael Hicks Beach
says that this should have been done, although a favourable
season for the operations of British troops might have
been lost, and the means of further arming and victualling
his forces given to Cetywayo; but the Secretary of State
does not say, and of course could not say, that it should
have been done at the imminent risk of the invasion and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
destruction of our colony at Natal. Yet, after all, that is
the true question. Sir Bartle Frere was specially charged,
under his commission, with the protection of our own
territory from native inroads, and was bound, in a great
emergency, to make use of his immense delegated power in
a prompt manner. Cetywayo, for two years, had been
arranging for a great special blow upon the white people.
He was couching ready to spring, and the High Commissioner
knew it was absolutely necessary to act at once.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Hence the commencement of hostilities early in January
within Zululand. If there had been no disaster at Isandhlwana
there would have been no censure. The ideas of
her Majesty's Government with regard to conditions of peace
will be found expressed in the Secretary of State's despatch,
dated the 20th of March:&mdash;No further interference with the
internal government is to be permitted than what is necessary
for securing the peace and safety of the adjacent
colonies. Duly authorized residents or agents to reside in
the country. The Zulu military system to be discontinued,
and missionaries to be admitted. These views necessarily
subject to modification by future events.</p>

<p>The battle of Ghinghelovo was fought upon the 2nd of
April, and the battle of Ulundi, which will be referred to in
due course, took place on the 4th of July. A complete
chronicle of the operations of the different columns during
the interval would be most tiresome and uninteresting.
Such a narrative would be occupied with little raids upon
the enemy, and of the enemy upon us; occasional scares;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the active operations from Wood's column in scouring the
country within forty miles; captures and losses of cattle;
movement of troops; fort-building; camp life; and, above
all, the troubles, anxieties, and annoyances of the slow
march towards the front and the difficulties of transport.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
Messengers, ostensibly from the king, came in at various
times to ask for peace; but, viewed in the light of subsequent
events, there is little doubt that such people
were merely sent as spies, with the double object of putting
us off our guard and obtaining information. An engagement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
took place on the 5th of June, between the enemy
and a portion of Brigadier-General Wood's column, which
requires more than mere passing mention. As an attack
was expected on the line of march, reinforcements of
cavalry (Lancers and Dragoons) as well as mounted natives
were sent. Colonel Buller, with two troops of Frontier
Light Horse, and detachments of Baker's and McDonald's
forces, together with Cochrane's Mounted Basutos, formed
a scouting force in advance. Lord William Beresford
assisted Colonel Buller as staff officer. The 90th Regiment
formed the advance-guard of the main column, the 80th
was in the centre, and the 1-13th formed the rear-guard.
Two large bodies of Zulus, about 1000 in number, were
observed near the large kraal of Usirayo, and they seemed
by their position to challenge an attack. Our men were
ordered to advance at a trot, and the enemy retired into
the belt of thornbush surrounding the base of the mountain,
from which they poured a heavy fire. After half an hour's
fusillade from each side the enemy's fire began to slacken.
Lancers and Dragoons crossed the river, but, not being
supported by artillery, were unable to dislodge the Zulus,
and unfortunately lost Adjutant Frith, a young officer of
great promise. Subsequently the troop of Natal mounted
natives under Shepstone checkmated an attempt of the
enemy to cut off our retiring vedettes. After this the Zulus
contented themselves with shouting out defiance. The
British troops returned, having previously burned the
kraals and ascertained the approximate number of the
enemy assembled to oppose the march of the column. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
is noteworthy that on this occasion the conduct of the
regular troops and volunteers is described as manifesting
both pluck and steadiness.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Prince Imperial.</i></div>

<p>We must now advert to the career of the most distinguished
volunteer of the war, a prince who owned the
most conspicuous dynastic name of the time&mdash;Napoleon
Louis Bonaparte, Prince Imperial of France. Born in the
purple and brought up amidst the greatest magnificence,
the misfortunes of France became his own, and as an exile
in England he studied at the Military College of Woolwich,
where his success far surpassed even the sanguine expectations
of his friends. The war in South Africa seemed to
offer a sphere in which the heir of conquerors could learn
to conquer. As a soldier, the prince earnestly desired to
attain practical knowledge of his profession; as a Napoleon,
he thirsted to distinguish himself by taking the sword each
of his family had experienced to be the Key of Empire.
Great Britain was the refuge of his family, and among the
soldiers of Great Britain he felt at home. On the 27th of
February, 1879, Prince Louis Napoleon received the sacrament
of the Catholic Church before the Emperor's tomb at
Chiselhurst, and then embarked in the steamer <i>Danube</i> for
the theatre of war. His determination to go to Zululand
was absolutely his own act, and his brave mother had to
yield to his judgment what her own heart opposed. The
prince was singularly calculated to win the affection of all.
Pure, wise, and Christian, he had declared, "If I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
restored to the throne of my father, I will have none near
me whose truth, honour, and morality are not above suspicion."
As free from affectation as possible, he was gay,
simple, affable, and so full of kindliness as to draw to him
the hearts of all with whom he came in contact. On
the voyage out he mixed with the passengers as one of
them, joined in their games, and made himself beloved as
much by the charm of his manner as the goodness of his
nature.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Arrived at Cape Town, the prince became the
guest of Lady Frere, the Governor being absent in Natal.
He only remained there a few days, during the stay of the
<i>Danube</i>, and went on in that steamer to Natal. The prince
had received permission from the authorities to accompany
the staff of the British army, and the Duke of Cambridge
had written letters on this subject to Lord Chelmsford and
to Sir Bartle Frere.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The prince in action.</i></div>

<p>With that hatred of ostentation and desire of giving as
little trouble as possible which markedly actuated all the
proceedings of the prince, he merely took one servant to the
front, and even left his faithful companion, M. Uhlmann,
at D'Urban. Towards the end of April indisposition prevented
his joining the head-quarters staff of Lord Chelmsford,
but he was delayed only a few days in Pietermaritzburg.
It soon became evident to all his companions in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
arms that the prince was the bravest of the brave. No
idea of fear ever crossed his mind, and as this undaunted
disposition was not tempered by experience, it should have
induced greater watchfulness on the part of those men of
high rank in the British army who were virtually his guardians
during the campaign. In a reconnaissance which
took place on Sunday, the 18th of May, the prince displayed
that coolness in the face of danger for which he was
remarkable. On that day twenty-five men of Bettington's
Horse, and the mounted Basutos under Colonel Harrison,
accompanied by the Prince Imperial, crossed the Blood
river, and subsequently descended into the Ityotyozi valley,
where they were to meet Colonel Buller and 300 men.
They missed this force, however, and had to bivouac for
the night near the south-east extremity of the Incqutu.
No fires were allowed, and in shivering silence the night
was passed, the enemy being expected at any moment. At
daybreak they set off in quest of the road, and when
approaching an ascent leading to a large kraal, were fired
upon by sixty Zulus, who lined the ridge of rocks above.
This fusillade was immediately returned, and without any
hesitation Captain Bettington led straight up. The road
was exceedingly steep and covered with boulders, but by a
sudden charge the position was taken. Two Zulus were
killed and seven horses captured. The prince evidently
relished this engagement, and was as cool and collected
throughout as if sitting in his study. In the captured kraal
several relics of Isandhlwana were discovered, among which
was a saddle of Colonel Black's, 2-24th, empty boxes of
Martini-Henry, and an artillery forge bellows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>To show the narrow escapes which sometimes occurred,
an incident that followed this little engagement may be
related. Captain Bettington rode after three Zulus, two of
whom were armed with guns and one with assegai. Thinking
he was unarmed, they allowed him to come within ten
yards. He called out and fired his revolver; two of the
three loaded chambers missed fire, and one of the Zulus
was just taking aim with his gun at a distance of only
fifteen yards, when the third chamber exploded and the
man fell dead. The other two ran away, and the remainder
of the patrol came up shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>The prince was exceedingly fond of real work, and of
sharing every privation and danger of his comrades. He
was no feather-bed soldier. Anxious always to go out with
patrols and on reconnaissance duty, it would have seemed
ungracious to check his ardour, but his own daring and
utter absence of fear made it specially necessary that men
of tried experience should accompany him. At the commencement
of June the Prince Imperial, attached to the
Quartermaster-General's department, was at General
Newdigate's camp. He had applied for and obtained leave
to go on ahead of the division to the site of the new camp
about to be formed. On the morning of the 1st of June,
the reconnoitring party set out, consisting of the Prince
Imperial, Lieutenant Carey of H.M. 98th Regiment, six
selected men of Bettington's Horse, and one Kafir. Six
mounted Basutos had been ordered to join the party, but
they were left behind. The spot to which they were about
to proceed was familiar to the prince, and he was aware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Death of the prince.</i></div>

<p>that it was in the vicinity of Lord Chelmsford's camp on
one side, and of General Wood's on the other. The party
started at half-past nine o'clock, and when they arrived at
the neck of the Incenci mountain were joined by some
officers, who, after riding some distance with them, went off
towards the left, in the direction of General Wood's camp.
After crossing a rivulet which forms a tributary to the
Ityotyozi river, they reached a large flat-topped hill, and
there the prince, ordering the men to slacken girths for a
little, took a sketch of the country.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after the march was resumed, the prince pointed
out the kraal from which he had been fired upon on a
previous occasion, and turned off to examine another one,
which was found empty. Immediately afterwards the party
descended towards a third kraal, about a mile further on,
as the prince observed a small river&mdash;the Mbazani&mdash;at
which the horses could be watered, and where coffee could
be made for the men. The kraal consisted of five huts, with
a small stone enclosure, and was distant about 200 yards
from the river. In front there was an open space, on which
fires for cooking had been made, but between the kraal and
the river tambookie grass grew, five or six feet in height,
with mealies and Kafir corn interspersed. The party halted
on the open space, and the prince gave the order to "off
saddle" for an hour. No sign of life was visible, except
where two or three dogs furtively ran from the intruders.
Water was obtained, coffee made, the horses were turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
into the grass and grain crops, while with a feeling of
perfect security all lay stretched, resting, on the ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The prince's heroism.</i></div>

<p>The hour quickly passed, and during that time,
unknown and unsuspected, fifty Zulus crawled in ambush
preparing to make a spring. The position of the ground
was most advantageous for their purpose. A deep donga
formed excellent cover, and out of that they crept along the
water's edge, completely screened by the rank vegetation.
It was while they were thus concealed that one of them was
seen by the Kafir sent to bring water to the Prince Imperial's
party. The Zulu burst out of his ambush and fled.
The Kafir returned and reported what he had seen. Meanwhile
the prince, looking at his watch, remarked, "You
can give your horses ten minutes more." What the Kafir
reported had, however, made every one anxious to go, and
the horses were caught and saddled. All stood ready, and
the prince examined the bit of his horse for a few moments.
Then came the words, "Prepare to mount! Mount!"
and almost at the same moment a volley fired from forty
rifles, at a distance of twenty yards, crashed among them.
At this time the party were standing in line, close to their
horses, with their backs to the kraal and their faces turned
eastward, the prince being in front and nearest to the
Zulus. Then with a tremendous cry, "Usutu!" and "Lo,
the English cowards!" the savages rushed on. The horses
immediately swerved, and some broke away. An undoubted
panic seized the party; every one who could spring on his
horse mounted and galloped for his life. There was no
thought nor idea of standing fast and resisting this sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
attack. The prince was unwounded, but unable to mount
his charger, which was sixteen hands high, and always
difficult to mount. On this occasion the horse became so
frightened by the firing and sudden stampede, as to rear
and prance in such a manner as to make it impossible for
the prince to gain the saddle. Many of the others saw the
difficulty, but none waited or tried to give the least assistance.
One by one they rushed their horses past, Private
Le Tocq exclaiming as he went by, lying across his saddle,
"Dépêchez-vous, s'il vous plaît, monsieur." The prince,
making no reply, strained every nerve, but, alas! in vain, to
gain the back of his horse, holding his stirrup-leather with
his left hand and the saddle with his right. With the help
of the holster he made one desperate effort, but the holster
partially gave way, and it must have been then that the
horse trod upon him, and galloped off, leaving his master
prostrate on the ground. The prince then regained his
feet and ran after his friends, who were far in advance.
Twelve or thirteen Zulus were at this time only a few feet
behind him. The prince then turned round, and, sword in
hand, faced his pursuers. From the first he had never
called for help, and now died bravely with his face to
the foes, fighting courageously to the last. It is thought
that the Zulus hurled their assegais at him, and that he
quickly fell dead, pierced through the eye by a mortal
wound.</p>

<p>In death, as in life, the Prince Imperial of France
behaved as a brave soldier, the worthy heir of a great cause
and a true son of France. No torture or pain accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
his last moments. His first wound was mortal, and the
noble and beloved prince in his last moments, as during his
entire career, did nothing to sully the name he bore or the
country which gave him birth.</p>

<p>Two of the troopers were shot. One of them, Rogers,
never reached his horse, and received his death wound
when standing by a hut, rifle in hand, preparing to defend
himself. Trooper Abel was shot at the first discharge&mdash;at
all events, before he could reach the donga. The Kafir
who had accompanied them and had brought the water for
coffee, was quickly surrounded and killed. The rest of the
party galloped off at full speed. Lieutenant Carey and
two others crossed the donga at a difficult place, while the
others, who were followed by the prince, took an easier
route. The direction taken by the fugitives was General
Wood's camp. Lieutenant Carey, shortly after starting,
called out, "Keep to the left, and cross the donga, and
rally behind it." At the same time he noticed Zulus
apparently endeavouring to cut off their retreat. On a
rise a little further on, he looked round, and one of the
troopers, who happened to be near him, called attention
to the prince's horse galloping away. In reply to a question,
the man said it was useless to return. The other
troopers were then 200 yards distant. Lieutenant Carey
shouted out to them to keep to the left, and all made the
best of their way to the camp, which was reached at
6.30 p.m.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lieutenant Carey's report.</i></div>

<p>It ought specially to be noted that the attack of the
Zulus was a thorough surprise by an overwhelming force.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
No sentries bad been posted, nor precautions of any kind
taken, and at the time of the attack no carbines were
loaded. Lieutenant Carey says that he did not notice the
prince after he saw him mounting, and that he did not
perceive any fighting when he looked round.</p>

<p>General Wood and Colonel Buller met Lieutenant Carey
and the other survivors of the party. These officers were
at the time about six miles from camp, and four or five
from Isandhlwana mountain, when they saw five white men
riding as if for their lives under the hills on the right. So
soon as the fugitives saw the general and his escort, they
came up to them at full gallop, and told the dreadful news.
By means of field-glasses three horses were seen being led
off at a distance of about seven miles, accompanied by
twenty or thirty Zulus on foot. It was then nearly five
in the afternoon, and too late to do anything. On the
following morning (Whit Monday) the advanced guard of
Natal Native Contingent and Raaff's Horse pushed forward
from Wood's camp to the scene of the disaster. They were
joined there by squadrons of Lancers and Dragoons from
General Newdigate. The search for the bodies was not
a long one. That of poor Rogers was first found, lying
stark naked, riddled with assegai stabs and with a gash
in the abdomen. Thirty yards distant was that of Abel
in the same condition. A wound in his right hand seemed
to show that he had fought for his life at close quarters.
Thirty yards or so from this, and in the donga, lay the
corpse of the Prince Imperial. Surgeon-Major Scott,
specially deputed for the purpose by Lord Chelmsford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
took charge of the body and proceeded to examine it.
There was one longish wound on the right breast, which
was evidently mortal; an assegai had pierced the right eye,
and had at once either caused death or paralysis to pain.
There were two wounds in the left side, and less serious
ones all over the upper part of the chest. A long gash
in the abdomen exposed the intestines, but had not injured
them. Round the neck was a small gold chain, to which
was attached a medal and Agnus Dei. These the Zulus
had not dared to touch, as they look upon all such articles
as charms to be dreaded. The body of the prince was then
conveyed to camp, and those of the troopers were buried
with religious ceremony.</p>

<p>It is now necessary to furnish the evidence taken at the
court-martial and the statement of Lieutenant Carey. The
preliminary report was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Court is of opinion that Lieutenant Carey did not
understand the position in which he stood towards the
prince, and, as a consequence, failed to estimate aright
the responsibility which fell to his lot. Colonel Harrison
states that the senior combatant officer, Lieutenant Carey,
D.A.Q.M.G., was, as a matter of course, in charge of the
party, whilst on the other hand Carey says, when alluding
to the escort, 'I did not consider I had any authority over
it, after the precise and careful instructions of Lord Chelmsford
as to the position the prince held.' As to his being
invariably accompanied by an escort in charge of an officer,
the Court considers that the possibility of such a difference
of opinion should not have existed between two officers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the same department. The Court is of opinion that Carey
is much to blame for having proceeded on the duty in
question with a portion only of the escort detailed by
Colonel Harrison. The Court cannot admit the irresponsibility
for this on the part of Carey, inasmuch as he took
steps to obtain the escort, and failed in so doing. Moreover,
the fact that Harrison was present upon the Itelezi
range gave him the opportunity of consulting him on the
matter, of which he failed to avail himself. The Court,
having examined the ground, is of opinion that the selection
of the kraal where a halt was made and the horses
off saddled, surrounded as it was by cover for an enemy,
and adjacent to difficult ground, showed a lamentable want
of military prudence. The Court deeply regrets that no
effort was made after the attack to rally the escort, and
to show a front to the enemy, whereby the possibility of
aiding those who had failed to make good their retreat
might have been ascertained.&mdash;Signed by General Marshall;
Colonel Malthus, 94th Regiment; Major Le Grice, R.A."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The court-martial.</i></div>

<p>On this report a court-martial was summoned by Lord
Chelmsford, for the trial of Lieutenant Carey, for having
misbehaved before the enemy on the 1st June, 1879, when
in command of an escort in attendance on the prince, who
was making reconnaissances in Zululand, in having, when
the prince and escort were attacked by the enemy, galloped
away, and in not having attempted to rally them or otherwise
defend the prince. The Court, under the presidency
of Colonel Glyn, consisted of Colonels Whitehead, Courtney,
Harness, Major Bouverie, and Major Anstruther.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Judge-Advocate Brander prosecuted, and Captain
Crookenden, R.A., was for the defence.</p>

<p>When the Court opened the plan of the ground was
proved.</p>

<p>Corporal Grubb said the prince gave the order "Off
saddle" at the kraal, and "Prepare to mount." The
prince mounted. After the volley, he saw Carey putting
spurs to his horse, and he did the same. He saw Abel fall,
and Rogers trying to get a shot at the Zulus. Le Tocq
passed him, and said, "Put spurs to your horse, boy; the
prince is down!" He looked round and saw the prince
under his horse. A short time after the prince's horse
came up, and he (Grubb) caught it. No orders were given
to rally.</p>

<p>Le Tocq was called, and said: The prince told the
natives to search the kraals, and finding no one there they
off saddled. At the volley, he mounted, but, dropping his
carbine, stopped to pick it up. In remounting he could
not get his leg over the saddle. He passed the prince, and
said in French, "Hasten to mount your horse." The
prince did not answer. He saw the prince's horse treading
on his leg. The prince was in command of the party.
He believed Carey and the prince would have passed on
different sides of a hut in fast flight, and it was possible
that Carey might have failed to see that the prince was
in difficulty. It was 250 yards from where he saw the
prince down to the spot where he died.</p>

<p>Trooper Cochrane was called, and said: The prince was
not in the saddle at the time of mounting. He saw, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
fifty yards off, the prince running down the donga with
fourteen Zulus in close pursuit. Nothing was done to help
him. He heard no orders given, and did not tell Carey
what he had seen until some time after. He was an
old soldier. He did not think any rally could have been
made.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Examination of witnesses.</i></div>

<p>The Court then adjourned to the next day. On reassembling,
the first witness called was&mdash;</p>

<p>Sergeant Willis, who stated that he had seen Trooper
Rogers lying on the ground by the side of his horse, close
to the kraal, as he left the spot. He thought he saw the
prince wounded at the same time that Trooper Abel threw
up his arms. He thought the prince might have been
dragged to the place where he was found after death, and
that a rally might have been made twenty yards beyond
the donga.</p>

<p>Colonel Harrison being called, stated that Carey was
senior combatant officer, and must therefore have been in
command of the party. Carey volunteered to go on the
reconnaissance to verify certain points of his sketch. The
prince was ordered to go to report more fully on the ground.
He had given the prince into Carey's charge.</p>

<p>Examined by the Court, Colonel Harrison stated that
when the prince was attached to his department he was not
told to treat him as a royal personage in the matter of
escort, but as any other officer, taking due precaution
against any possible danger.</p>

<p>Dr. Scott (the prince's medical attendant) was then
called, and stated that the prince was killed by eighteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
assegai wounds, any five of which would have been fatal.
There were no bullet wounds. The prince died where the
body was found.</p>

<p>This closed the case for the prosecution. The defence
called again&mdash;</p>

<p>Colonel Harrison, who testified to Carey's abilities as a
staff officer, and said he had every confidence in him.</p>

<p>Colonel Bellairs was also called, and stated that it was
in consequence of the occurrence of the 1st June that
Carey had been deposed from his staff appointment the day
previous to his trial.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Carey here submitted that his case had
been prejudged, and that he had been punished before his
trial.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lieutenant Carey.</i></div>

<p>The following is Lieutenant Carey's statement:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On the 31st May, I was informed by Colonel Harrison,
A.Q.M.G., that the Prince Imperial was to start on the
1st June, to ride over the road selected by me for the
advance of the column, for the purpose of selecting a
camping ground for the 2nd June. I suggested at once
that I should be allowed to go with him, as I knew the
road and wanted to go over it again for the purpose of
verifying certain points. To this Colonel Harrison consented,
reminding me that the prince was going at his own
request to do this work, and that I was not to interfere
with him in any way. For our escort, six Europeans of
Bettington's Horse and six Basutos were ordered. Bettington's
men were paraded at 9 a.m., but owing to some misunderstanding
the Basutos did not turn up, and, the prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
being desirous of proceeding at once, we went without
them. On arriving at the ridge between Itelezi and Incenci,
I suggested waiting for them, but the prince replied,
'Oh no; we are quite strong enough,' or words to that
effect. We proceeded on our reconnaissance from there,
halting about half an hour on a high hill overlooking the
Ityotyozi for the prince to sketch. From here the country
was visible for miles, and no sign of the enemy could be
discovered. We then descended into the valley, and,
entering a kraal, off saddled, knee-haltering our horses.
We had seen the deserted appearance of the country, and,
though the kraal was to the right surrounded by mealies,
we thought there was no danger in encamping. If any
blame is attributable to any one for this, it is to me, as I
agreed with the prince that we were perfectly safe. I had
been over this ground twice before, and seen no one, and
the brigade-major of the cavalry brigade had ridden over
it with only two or three men, and laughed at me for
taking so large an escort. We had with us a friendly
Zulu, who, in answer to my inquiries, said no Zulus were
about. I trusted in him, but still kept a sharp look-out,
telescope in hand. In about an hour&mdash;that is, at 3.40 p.m.&mdash;the
prince ordered us to saddle up. We went into the
mealies to catch our horses, but took at least ten minutes
saddling. While doing so, the Zulu guide informed us he
had seen a Zulu in the distance, but as he did not appear
concerned, I saw no danger. The prince was saddled up
first, and, seeing him ready, I mounted, the men not being
quite ready. The prince then asked if they were all ready;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
they answered in the affirmative, and he gave the word
'Prepare to mount.' At this moment I turned round, and
saw the prince with his foot in the stirrup, looking at the
men. Presently I heard him say, 'Mount,' and turning
to the men, saw them vault into their saddles. At this
moment my eyes fell on about twenty black faces in the
mealies, twenty to thirty yards off, and I saw puffs of
smoke and heard a rattling volley, followed by a rush, with
shouts of 'Usutu!' There was at once a stampede. Two
men rushed past me, and as every one appeared to be
mounted, I dug the spurs into my horse, which had already
started of his own accord. I felt sure no one was wounded
by the volley, as I heard no cry, and I shouted out, 'Keep
to the left, and cross the donga, and rally behind it!' At
the same time I saw more Zulus in the mealies on our left
flank, cutting off our retreat. I crossed the donga behind
two or three men, but could only get beyond one man,
the others having ridden off. Riding a few hundred yards
on to the rise, I stopped and looked round. I could see
the Zulus after us, and saw that the men were escaping
to the right, and that no one appeared on the other side
of the donga. The man beside me then drew my attention
to the prince's horse, which was galloping away on the
other side of the donga, saying, 'I fear the prince is
killed, sir.' I immediately said, 'Do you think it is any
use going back?' The trooper pointed to the mealies on
our left, which appeared full of Kafirs, and said, 'He is
dead long ago, sir: they assegai wounded men at once.'
I considered he had fallen near the kraal, as his horse was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
going from that direction, and it was useless to sacrifice
more lives. I had but one man near me, the others being
some 200 yards down the valley. I accordingly shouted
to them to close to the left, and rode on to gain a drift
over the Tombokala river, saying to the man at my side,
'We will keep back towards General Wood's camp, not
returning the same way we came, and then come back with
some Dragoons to get the bodies.' We reached camp about
6.30 p.m. When we were attacked our carbines were unloaded,
and, to the best of my belief, no shots were fired.
I did not see the prince after I saw him mounting, but he
was mounted on a swift horse, and I thought he was close
to me. Besides the prince, we lost two troopers, as well
as the friendly Zulu. Two troopers have been found between
the donga and the kraal, covered with assegai
wounds. They must have fallen in the retreat and been
assegaied at once, as I saw no fighting when I looked
round."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Grief in Natal.</i></div>

<p>A shudder of horror and reproachful regret passed
through Natal. It was sorrowful that the prince should
be killed, but doubly lamentable that he should fall by the
assegais of savages when his comrades deserted him. In
the army the feeling of indignation and regret was particularly
strong; and, however desirous men felt to do
justice, it was scarcely possible for human nature to be
entirely free from prejudice in forming a judgment with
regard to the conduct of those who had been with the
prince on the fatal day of his death. The court-martial
condemned Lieutenant Carey, and sent him home under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
arrest. But a reaction of opinion subsequently took
place. The Empress interceded for the unfortunate man,
and our own Queen was pleased to order his release from
arrest.</p>

<p>The death of the Prince Imperial was felt as a personal
grief by every colonist. It spread gloom throughout the
country, and recalled vividly the shock that followed the
disaster at Isandhlwana. The generous ardour with which
the prince had given his services to the cause of the
colonists seemed to have received a pitiful return. The
heir of an Empire was dead, and the news must go hence
to a widowed mother, who had made England her home.
Every possible manifestation of grief and respect was paid.
The military and the military authorities vied with the
civil authorities and the people in doing honour to the
illustrious dead. Natal went into mourning. When the
corpse arrived at Pietermaritzburg, people of all classes
crowded into the streets to show their respect by joining
the procession. The <i>Times</i> of Natal tells us that on the
8th of June, at 1.15 p.m., a gun was fired from Fort Napier,
announcing that the body had arrived within two miles of
the city, and by two o'clock a number which must have
exceeded 3000 had assembled at the place of rendezvous on
the Commercial Road. Here the procession was formed,
the military headed by Major-General the Hon. H. H.
Clifford, Inspector-General of Communications, on the one
side; and the civilians, headed by his Excellency Sir
Henry Bulwer, the Lieutenant-Governor of the colony,
on the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The body brought to Natal.</i></div>

<p>Thousands of people lined the way up to the place
where the procession had to fall in, and some time was
taken before all were in their places in the order above
indicated. Following the civil authorities, came the City
Guard, some sixty strong, under Colonel Mitchell as
general leader, and J. H. Spence as district leader; and
after them came a large number of the Odd Fellows and
Foresters in the funeral insignia of their order. After this
the general public followed, all in mourning.</p>

<p>The arrangements being completed, amid the solemn
booming of the minute guns, and the tolling of the church
bells, the gun-carriage bearing the coffin was seen slowly
coming down the hill, accompanied by the escort of regulars
and mounted police which had come with it. As it
approached the military fell into their places, and there
was a hush which spoke, more eloquently than any words,
the feelings of the vast concourse of people as the body of
the late prince approached. As the <i>cortège</i> passed every
hat was raised in respect, and the military presented arms.
The coffin was wrapped in a large tricolour, and upon it
was a helmet and sword, together with wreaths of roses
and camellias, and a beautiful cross of violets; while the
grey charger, draped with a black pall, with the letter
"N" on the corners, and with the boots reversed, according
to military custom, followed. The procession then formed
in the order given above, Major-General Clifford and the
Lieutenant-Governor being immediately in front, while
behind it were Fathers De Lacy and Baudry, the latter of
whom had just come down with the body. In the procession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
were observed many clergy of the English Church and
of other denominations, among them the Right Reverend
Bishop Colenso, the Right Reverend Bishop Macrorie,
Dean Green, Archdeacon Usherwood, the Rev. G. M.
St. M. Ritchie, chaplain to the forces, etc., etc. The two
valets of the late prince immediately followed the Catholic
clergy. The pall-bearers were Captain Willoughby, 21st
Scots Fusiliers; Captain Fox, R.A., D.A.A.G.; Major
Russell, 12th Lancers; Lieutenant-Colonel East, 57th Foot,
D.Q.M.G.; Lieutenant-Colonel Steward, R.E.; Colonel
Reilly, C.B., R.H.A. The personal staff in attendance upon
Major-General Clifford were Captain Fox, R.A., D.A.A.G.,
and Lieutenant Westmacott, 77th Regiment, A.D.C.
General Bisset was also present, in full uniform. Major
Spalding, D.A.A.G., acted as adjutant-general, in the
absence of Colonel Bellairs. Amongst the civil servants
were the Attorney-General, Hon. M. H. Gallwey; the
Colonial Treasurer, Hon. Mr. Polkinghorne; the Surveyor-General,
Mr. P. C. Sutherland, M.D.; the Mayor of Maritzburg,
Mr. W. Francis, and the Town Councillors; Mr. W.
Akerman, M.L.C., and Mr. C. C. Griffin, M.L.C.; and
all the heads of departments who were not either absent
from Maritzburg or prevented from being present by
sickness.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lord Clifford's special order.</i></div>

<p>The Maritzburg Rifles assembled in full number, under
Lieutenant and Adjutant Scoones, and their band played
the Dead March in "Saul," adding greatly to the solemnity
of the procession. It marched slowly up Commercial
Road to the corner of Church Street, up which it turned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and then wheeled along Chapel Street into Longmarket
Street, arriving at the Roman Catholic School at about
ten minutes before four. Here the coffin was taken from
the gun-carriage by the pall-bearers, and conveyed into
the chapel, followed by as many of the procession as the
building would hold, the military who were on the ground
being formed into two lines outside the building. The
Rev. Father Barrett met the procession at the door, and,
together with Father De Lacy and Father Baudry,
officiated, reading a short service over the coffin; all
present appearing deeply affected. The military were then
drawn up outside the building, and his Excellency and
other distinguished personages passed through the lines,
and the doors of the building were then closed upon the
mortal remains of the late lamented prince.</p>

<p class="b1">The following special order had been issued by General
Clifford:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn70 reduct">
"Wednesday, June 4th.</p>

<p class="pbq">"The Inspector-General of Lines of Communication and
Base has received from his Excellency the Lieutenant-General
commanding official confirmation of the calamity
which has befallen the forces under his command, by the
death, on duty in the field, of the late gallant young soldier
the Prince Imperial, Louis Napoleon, who, having in his
military training been associated with the British army,
came out to this country to take part in the Zulu campaign.</p>

<p class="pbq">"The Inspector-General feels that he is carrying out the
wishes of his Excellency the Lieutenant-General commanding,
now in Zululand, by thus recording the feelings of deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
sorrow and sympathy, experienced by every officer and
man whose duty keeps him at his post in the colony, with
the loss thus sustained.</p>

<p class="pbq">"The body of the unfortunate prince will arrive here
probably on Monday next, the 9th inst., <i>en route</i> to England.
Arrangements will be made to receive it with all due respect
and expression of sorrow."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">From the capital city of Pietermaritzburg, the body of
the prince was conveyed to D'Urban, the seaport, and at
the latter place the following eloquent special order was
issued by the Assistant Adjutant-General.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p class="pn70 p1">"10th June, 1879.</p>

for embarkation in H.M.S. <i>Boadicea</i> to England.</p>

<p class="pbq">"In following the coffin which holds the body of the late
Prince Imperial of France, and paying to his ashes the
final tribute of sorrow and of honour, the troops in garrison
will remember:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq">"First. That he was the last inheritor of a mighty
name, and of a great military renown.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Second. That he was the son of England's firm ally

on English shores.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">"Deepening the profound sorrow, and the solemn reverence

<div class="sidenote"><i>Funeral ceremonies at D'Urban.</i></div>

<p class="p1">The Roman Catholic Church at D'Urban was transformed
into a <i>chapelle ardente</i>, and the coffin remained
there all night after its arrival. Solemn requiem Mass was
celebrated the next morning. The <i>Natal Mercury</i> tells us
that by nine o'clock an immense crowd of persons had
assembled outside the church where the gun-carriage was
in waiting, and every arrangement had been made for
speedily forming the procession after the ceremony was
over. The principal object of interest outside was the
grey horse belonging to the late prince, which he had
purchased from a D'Urban gentleman, and the groom in
charge of it was busily engaged in answering questions put
to him with regard to the late prince. The horse was
saddled, and in just the same condition as it was when it
came back riderless to the camp. The troops outside
waiting to take part in the procession numbered altogether
700; the whole, as on the previous day, being under the
command of Major Huskisson, commandant of the garrison.
Every regiment doing service in South Africa was represented,
including even the Dragoons and Lancers. At
a quarter to ten the doors of the church were thrown
open, and the coffin was brought to the gun-carriage, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
honour of carrying it having been conferred on Captain
Haynes (staff paymaster), Captain Granville (commissariat),
Captain Young (commissariat), Captain Brunker, Commissary
Marsh (ordnance), and Surgeon-Major Leslie.</p>

<p>The procession was constituted as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">Having proceeded to the Point, the coffin was conveyed
by a small steamer to H.M.S. <i>Boadicea</i>, where it was taken
on board and hoisted into the hold of the vessel amid all
the reverent marks of respect so fitting for the occasion.
Monsieur Deleage, correspondent of the Paris <i>Figaro</i>,
with two of the prince's attendants, accompanied the
remains.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="pni05">THE POLICY OF SIR BARTLE FRERE&mdash;SLOW ADVANCE OF
THE BRITISH COLUMNS&mdash;APPOINTMENT AND ARRIVAL
OF SIR GARNET WOLSELEY&mdash;BATTLE OF ULUNDI&mdash;RESIGNATION
AND DEPARTURE OF LORD CHELMSFORD.</p>

<p class="p2">The policy of Sir Bartle Frere received the hearty and
most earnest support of those people who were best
qualified to judge of it, the colonists of Natal and the
Cape Colony. At large and enthusiastic public meetings
held in every town of any consequence unanimous votes of
approval and sympathy were passed. In the city of Cape
Town a great mass meeting declared unanimously for Sir
Bartle Frere. Graham's Town expressed itself in the same
manner. Port Elizabeth notified its fullest confidence in
his Excellency the High Commissioner, "being persuaded
that the policy he is seeking to carry out in South Africa
is eminently calculated to secure the permanent tranquillity
of the country and the welfare of its inhabitants. King
William's Town heartily sympathizes with his Excellency,
and expresses its entire confidence." Graaff-Reinet, "having
heard with the greatest satisfaction the manner in which
the metropolis has come forward to approve of the policy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of his Excellency Sir Bartle Frere, cordially endorses the
Cape Town resolution." Swellendam recorded its "satisfaction
with the well-timed movement in Cape Town;"
George Town notified its approval; Queen's Town expressed
its cordial sympathy and confidence; Kimberley declared
strongly in favour of Sir Bartle Frere, and, of course, so
did Pietermaritzburg, D'Urban, and other towns in Natal.
In fact, from east to west, from north to south, all classes,
all creeds, all nationalities, were unanimous in upholding
the only policy which they considered could serve South
Africa. Bishop Colenso in Natal, and several other able
men in Cape Town, held different views, but then their
number was so very small as to detract in a very small
measure from the unanimity of the expression of feeling.
At these public meetings hearty votes of thanks were also
passed to her Majesty's Government for having sent out
reinforcements.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Anxiety of the colonists.</i></div>

<p>There can be no doubt whatever that during April,
May, and June, there was a very dissatisfied feeling in the
colonies, as well as at home, with regard to the exceeding
tardiness of operations. The small irritating raids made
at different times upon Zululand cannot be styled successful,
and resulted in reprisals which were calculated to have
a demoralizing effect upon our own natives. If Colonel
Wood had been reasonably reinforced and allowed to go
forward, there is good reason to believe that he could have
finished the war. Up to the 18th of May his troops had
been successful in seven skirmishes and one pitched battle.
They had burnt the great Maquilizine military kraal, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
captured 9000 head of cattle. This light brigade was
admirably adapted for Zulu warfare. Pearson's column
on the coast had also performed admirable service. The
extraordinary difficulties and delays of transport under the
new organization in the second campaign have been already
referred to. Lord Chelmsford, writing to the Secretary of
State from Newcastle, Natal, on the 14th of May, states
that the troops are in position, only waiting for sufficient
supplies and transport to advance. From what the general
commanding had learnt from General Clifford,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> he feared
that it would be out of his power to advance until the 1st
of June. Major-General Crealock, commanding the first
(coast) division, reported that he hoped to have two months'
supplies in three weeks' time on the Inyezane river. The
posts on the northern line had all been visited, and head-quarters
fixed at Utrecht, until such time as the second
division, under General Newdigate, was ready to advance.
Shortly afterwards, information was received that the
border tribes were massing at Babincinqu and Inyayene,
two points near the Blood river, and that the Zulus had
sent for reinforcements to Ulundi. Rest and security for
two entire months had now been given to the enemy, and
their determination to continue the war was perfectly
evident, in spite of the illusory messages, asking for conditions
of peace, which were periodically sent to the British
camps. On the 26th of May, General Wood advanced his
column eight miles, and General Newdigate proceeded a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
distance of twelve miles towards the Blood river. Lord
Chelmsford established his head-quarters at Kopje Alleen.
Not until the middle of June could Port Durnford be used
for sending supplies to General Crealock's coast column.
Great additional transport facilities were by this means
secured. On June 3rd a belief prevailed at the Lower
Tugela that an advance would be made as soon as the
supply of cattle for transport purposes was sufficient.
During all the operations the percentage of sickness was
not very great. In the early part of the war a large number
of men were invalided, particularly from the coast column.
The D'Urban hospitals were full, but the number of deaths
was not large, and as the cold season advanced sickness
became less. Zululand, during May, June, and July,
is, in fact, as healthy as any country in the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lord Chelmsford's head quarters.</i></div>

<p>The two northern columns moved on slowly. On the
7th of June Lord Chelmsford was at Nondanai river, where
a fortified post had been established. The 5th of June
was the date of Colonel Buller's skirmish, already referred
to, in which Lancers and Dragoons were engaged. On the
17th of June a correspondent reports that Newdigate's forces
were constantly occupied patrolling and shelling kraals
and dongas, with no appreciable result. At this time the
Zulus appeared in great force within sight of the camp at
Luneberg. Newdigate's column then marched to join
that of General Wood. The utmost possible precautions
were taken against surprise, both on the march and in
camp. At one place the rocks, which would have offered
excellent cover for an attacking force, were mined. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
mines could be fired by means of electricity from the
laager. Lines of galvanized wire were also placed round
the camp, which the soldiers styled "Cetywayo catchers."
The heliograph was used for signalling by means of
flashes, and turned out extremely useful. On the 26th of
June<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> the 1st Brigade, with the Naval Brigade, moved
from Fort Napoleon, and the long-expected junction of
the columns appeared at last likely to be effected. It was
certainly high time. The English imported horses in
Newdigate's<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> brigade were beginning to suffer from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
severity of weather and a scarcity of food, the Zulus had
abundance of time to collect a large army, and the immense
delay in striking a decisive blow discouraged our troops,
encouraged the enemy, and caused immense dissatisfaction
to the public at home and in the colony. The Imperial
Ministry at last seemed to partially yield to public pressure
and public opinion. Sir Garnet Wolseley was appointed
Commander-in-Chief and her Majesty's High Commissioner
for the Natal, Transvaal, and Zululand. In connection
with the burning questions of the day and the blame so
lavishly bestowed upon the civil and military leaders in
South Africa, the following despatch from the Secretary of
State ought to be read with careful attention. Sir Michael
Hicks Beach says (28th May, 1879):&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Sir Michael Hicks Beach.</i></div>

<p>"After full consideration of the condition of affairs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
South Africa, her Majesty's Government have decided that
the arrangements under which the chief civil and military
authority in the neighbourhood of the seat of war is
distributed among four different persons can no longer
be deemed adequate to the requirements of the present
juncture.</p>

<p>"2. In the number of imperial troops engaged, and the
expenditure incurred, the Zulu war has assumed dimensions
far exceeding those of any that has been carried on
for many years in South Africa; and it appears but too
evident that military operations have been seriously impeded
by a want of harmony between the civil and military
authorities, of which the difference that has arisen between
the Lieutenant-General commanding the forces and the
Lieutenant-Governor of Natal, with regard to the disposal
of a portion of the native levies called out for service, has
furnished a striking example.</p>

<p>"3. In such a matter the High Commissioner has no
power to interfere, but were it otherwise you would be
unable, in present circumstances, to interfere with any
practical effect. For the prompt action requisite in time
of war would entirely preclude the satisfactory reference
to Cape Town of this or any other of the numerous
questions requiring the decision of the High Commissioner;
while, on the other hand, your own presence at the seat
of war has become impossible. After an unavoidable protracted
absence from Cape Town (during which you have
laboured with singular zeal and energy to discharge all the
duties which have devolved upon you) you will be entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
occupied with many important matters necessarily postponed
until your return.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>New arrangements.</i></div>

<p>"4. The union of Griqualand West with the Cape, to the
settlement of which your recent visit to the province will
have largely contributed, has to be completed; the financial
questions jointly concerning the colony and this country
demand immediate attention; and important work remains
to be done in carrying out the recent legislation of the
Cape Parliament for the defence of the colony. But above
all her Majesty's Government are anxious that the larger
and more complicated questions connected with confederation,
on which I shall shortly address you, should be
considered, under your guidance, during the approaching
session of the Cape Parliament, and they attach special
importance to the advantages which may be derived from
your exertions in promoting this great work.</p>

<p>"5. Under these circumstances, Her Majesty's Government
have determined to place the chief military and civil
command in the eastern portion of South Africa in the
hands of one officer, and they have selected Lieutenant-General
Sir Garnet Wolseley, G.C.M.G., for this duty. His
high professional standing and his varied and distinguished
services preclude any question as to the fitness of placing
him for the time in supreme authority over the able men
now commanding her Majesty's troops in South Africa
and administering the Governments of Natal and the
Transvaal, and it is equally beyond question that he will
receive their most loyal and cordial support. Sir Garnet
Wolseley will, in addition to his military command, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
commissioned as Governor of Natal and of the Transvaal,
and High Commissioner for Native and Foreign Affairs
to the northward and eastward of those colonies. In the
latter capacity he will assume for the time that portion
of your functions which, at a crisis of such gravity as
the present, could not be performed by any High Commissioner
acting at a distance of more than 1000 miles
from the scene of operations. You will, I am confident, be
the first to recognize the necessity of the arrangement, and
will readily assist Sir Garnet Wolseley, should you have
returned to Cape Town by the time of his arrival there
on his way to enter upon the duties of his office, with
all the valuable information which your knowledge and
experience enable you to afford."</p>

<p>The Under-Secretary for War, writing to Lord Chelmsford
(29th May), says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have now to convey to you the intimation that her
Majesty's Government, having carefully considered the
information at their command, have come to the conclusion
that the satisfactory administration of affairs in that part
of South-Eastern Africa in the immediate neighbourhood
of the seat of war can at the present moment only be
carried out by placing that administration in the hands
of one person holding plenary powers, both civil and
military, and that they have selected Sir Garnet Wolseley
to discharge these duties.</p>

<p>"The Colonial Office will by this mail have informed
Sir Bartle Frere of this decision, and of its effects so far as
he himself is concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Appointment of Sir Garnet Wolseley.</i></div>

<p>"With respect to the military command though I have
the satisfaction of informing you that it is not intended
that the supersession caused by the appointment as High
Commissioner of an officer senior to yourself should be
considered as conveying censure on your proceedings, it
will nevertheless be your duty, as in the ordinary course
of service, to submit and to subordinate your plans to his
control. This decision was communicated to you
by telegram sent yesterday <i>viâ</i> St. Vincent, of which I enclose
a copy.</p>

<p>"Sir Garnet Wolseley, being qualified to act in a political
as well as in a military capacity, will be in possession
up to the latest date and in the fullest detail of the views of
her Majesty's Government; the responsibility placed upon
you by Sir Bartle Frere with regard to the enforcement
of his demands upon Cetywayo will therefore terminate
upon the arrival of the High Commissioner, and any overtures
for peace will henceforward be transmitted for decision
by him."</p>

<p>The news of Sir Garnet Wolseley's appointment was
received with the greatest satisfaction in South Africa.
The campaign had reached a very critical stage, and
the most contradictory and blundering reports about
the attitude of the Zulus were constantly circulated.
Cetywayo had been trying to deceive and gain time by
sending in messages for peace. Lord Chelmsford as a preliminary,
had asked that the guns taken at Isandhlwana<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
should be returned. At the same time that Cetywayo
pretended to desire peace, his people raided over our border
at Middle Drift, swooped down upon the friendly natives
near Luneberg, and endeavoured to enter into an alliance
with rebellious Boers. The impi that had been occupying
the Intombe valley was withdrawn into Zululand, and it
was clear that a concentration of forces was about to take
place at Ulundi.</p>

<p>Sir Garnet Wolseley arrived at Natal on the 27th of June.
His staff comprised Colonels Colley, Russell, and Brackenbury;
Major McCalmont; and Captains Lord Gifford,
Bushman, Yeatman Biggs, Maurice, Brathwaite and Doyle.
The Mayor and Corporation of D'Urban presented an
address to his Excellency, in which, after heartily welcoming
him, it is stated that British South Africa had unanimously
endorsed the consistent policy adopted and pursued by Sir
Bartle Frere, as the only means open for securing a lasting
and honourable peace. Sir Garnet Wolseley, in returning
thanks, expressed a hope that a strong and stable peace
might be gained, as a means to secure lasting immunity
from external discord and hostility. "Severe as is this
stress upon you, you must, I feel confident, see cause for
satisfaction in the patriotic and successful exertions with
which your volunteers have laboured to avert peril from
your country, and to maintain the prowess of English
arms in battle." The new General and High Commissioner
then proceeded to Pietermaritzburg, and shortly afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
returned and went by sea to Port Durnford, but being
unable to land there, was compelled to return to D'Urban,
and to proceed thence overland to the front.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Opinions as to the war.</i></div>

<p>A difference of opinion existed from the first as to the
necessity of the Zulu war, and with reference to the
character of Cetywayo. This became much more pronounced
after the disaster at Isandhlwana. It is a significant
fact that a very small minority of those who knew the
Zulus and lived in Natal shared the sentiments of the
British philanthropists, who lived securely at home, and
took upon themselves to condemn a policy with the reasons
for which they were only imperfectly acquainted. The
Bishop of Natal, Dr. Colenso, was, in South Africa, the
leader of the party who denounced the war. In the Blue
Books laid before Parliament interesting letters from his
able pen are published, in which he argues the Zulu case
exactly as if the race were a civilized one, which could
be expected to observe treaties, and with whom perfidy and
deceit were unknown. In a despatch from Sir Bartle
Frere, written from Pretoria, in the Transvaal, and dated
the 18th of April, the High Commissioner sums up the
arguments for war. These reasons utterly and completely
exclude any feeling or desire for vengeance, and all intention
to advance civilization, commerce, and Christianity by the
sword. It was absolutely necessary, however, that the
Zulu king should cease to reign, the military power of that
nation be broken up, and his people made to feel themselves
subject to the British power. Sir Bartle Frere
says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe that this is in the interests of the Zulus, no
less than of their neighbours.</p>

<p>"It is in the interest of the European population of
Natal and the Transvaal, because they cannot possibly live
in peace and quiet with the Zulus in their present state
as neighbours.</p>

<p>"The events of the last few months have rendered it
unnecessary to prove by argument that the Zulus have
been made into a great military power; that they can
destroy an English regiment, with artillery to support
it; or shut up or defeat a brigade six times as strong as
the ordinary garrison of Natal, unless our troops are very
carefully posted and very well handled.</p>

<p>"The open declarations of their king, no less than the
fundamental laws of their organization, proclaim foreign
conquest and bloodshed as a necessity of their existence.</p>

<p>"They are practically surrounded by British territory.
Except the Portuguese, there is now no foreign territory
they can reach for purposes of bloodshed without passing
through British territory.</p>

<p>"It is, therefore, clear that they cannot continue in
their present condition, with their present form of government
and present military organization, without attacking
British subjects, or, at best, unoffending neighbours, who
believe themselves safe as British subjects or allies.</p>

<p>"They make no prisoners save, occasionally, young
women and half-grown children. They show no quarter,
and give no chance to the wounded or disabled, disembowelling
them at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Sir Bartle Frere's views.</i></div>

<p>"They are separated from Natal by a river easily
fordable for the greater part of the year, and not too wide
to talk across at any time.</p>

<p>"The boundary between them and the Transvaal is even
more easily passed.</p>

<p>"All these, I submit, are incontrovertible facts, proved
by the well-known events of the past few months.</p>

<p>"I know that there are educated men to be found, of
great ability, who claim to be lovers of liberty and of right,
and of their own species, who have lived long near the
Zulus, and who say there is no danger to be apprehended
from them if we let them alone; that Cetywayo is a well-meaning
prince, quite within his own right in massacring
his own subjects, and our soldiers, too, if they enter his
territory; that all that is necessary to our own safety is
to let the Zulu king alone, or if the English do not like that,
to leave his neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"Having lived now for many weeks within a couple
of Zulu marches of the Zulu border, among sensible
Englishmen, many of them men of great sagacity, coolness,
and determination, and reasonably just and upright in all
their dealings, who never went to sleep without having
their arms within reach, and being prepared to take refuge
with wives and families at a minute's warning within a
fortified post; having learnt from 'voortrekkers' and their
children, who had witnessed the massacres of Weenen and
Blauwkrantz, and who could thus testify that the present
peculiarities of Zulu warfare are no recent innovation; I
may be allowed to doubt the possibility of making life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
within reach of a Zulu 'impi' permanently tolerable to
ordinary Englishmen and Dutchmen.</p>

<p>"Nor does it seem to me that we can justly say to
colonists, either in Natal or the Transvaal, that if they
do not like the situation they may go elsewhere.</p>

<p>"The Zulu right to be where the Zulus now are is,
with the exception of a small and remote tract towards
Delagoa Bay, simply one of recent conquest by devastation
and massacre.</p>

<p>"I have never heard the historical fact questioned that
the earlier Zulu 'impis' into what is now Natal and
Transvaal territory preceded by a very few years, if they
preceded at all, the first appearance of Dutch and English
adventurers in the same lands; and the Zulus certainly
cannot claim, as the Dutch and English may, any right
of occupation from having civilized or improved the
land.</p>

<p>"Hence it seems to me no more than natural justice that
if either party is to make way for the other, the Zulus
should yield, and not the English or Dutch.</p>

<p>"But I submit that in the interests of the Zulus themselves
we have no right to leave them to their fate.</p>

<p>"The present system of Cetywayo is no real choice of
the nation. It is simply a reign of terror, such as has
before now been imposed on some of the most civilized
nations of the world. The people themselves are everything
that could be desired as the unimproved material
of a very fine race. They seem to have all the capacities
for forming a really happy and civilized community, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
law, order, and right shall prevail, instead of the present
despotism of a ruthless savage.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Three courses before us.</i></div>

<p>"I can imagine but three ways of their being so
improved:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1st. They might, living alongside a civilized community,
gradually imbibe civilized ideas and habits.</p>

<p>"But for this it is necessary that their civilized neighbours
should be able to live in security, which, as I have
already said, seems to me hopeless, unless the military
organization and power of Cetywayo be broken down.</p>

<p>"2nd. There are the means of improvement which may
follow conquest and the breaking down of Cetywayo's
military system; and this seems to me the only reasonable
mode of doing our duty by these people. In the cases
of Abyssinia and Ashantee we were compelled by circumstances
to retire after conquest, and wash our hands of
all further responsibility for the future of those countries;
but there is no such necessity in the case of Zululand&mdash;there
is nothing to prevent our taking up and easily
carrying the burden of the duty laid upon us to protect and
civilize it.</p>

<p>"There is yet a third plan, which I have seen advocated
by high authority.</p>

<p>"The Zulus are, it is truly said, a nation of fine
national characteristics. They have qualities which might
enable them to become the regenerators and the foremost
in civilization of all the nations in South Africa.</p>

<p>"So far I can agree with those who hold the opinions
I refer to, but not in their further belief that Cetywayo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
is the Attila of the Zulus, and that if we only let him alone
he will develop into a Charlemagne or an Alfred.</p>

<p>"How far this process might be rendered tolerable
to the present civilized inhabitants of Natal and the
Transvaal, I will not stop to inquire. It is quite possible
that Zulus, overrunning their now civilized neighbours,
might in due time imbibe some of their civilization, settle
down, and become civilized themselves, absorbing through
their captives and subjects the germs of a better system of
national existence.</p>

<p>"I may doubt the probability of such a result, but I
will not contest its possibility, and will only say that I am
quite sure the countrymen of the present settlers in Natal
and the Transvaal will never leave the colonists there to be
made the subjects of any such experiment.</p>

<p>"I can, as I started by saying, see no alternative compatible
with our duty but effectually to subdue the Zulus,
and govern them as other South African races subject to
the British Crown are governed.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that no terms can possibly be made
with Cetywayo which can be compatible with such a result,
save with the indispensable preliminary of his entire submission."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Cetywayo's peace offers.</i></div>

<p>In the beginning of July Lord Chelmsford's column was
within ten miles of the king's kraal at Ulundi. Messengers
again arrived from Cetywayo, and on this occasion they
brought the sword of the Prince Imperial as a peace offering.
The amanuensis of Cetywayo was a Dutchman,
named Vogel, who took the opportunity of marking in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
pencil on the envelope of the letter, that the king had
20,000 men with him. The reply of Lord Chelmsford was
as follows:&mdash;"If the induna, Mundula, brings with him
the 1000 rifles taken at Isandhlwana, I will not insist on
1000 men coming in to lay down their arms, if the
Zulus are afraid to come. He must bring the two guns
and the remainder of the cattle. I will then be willing to
negotiate. As he has caused me to advance by the great
delay he has made, I must now go to the Umvolosi to
enable my men to drink. I will consent, pending negotiations,
to halt on the further bank of the river, and will not
burn any kraals until the 3rd of July, provided no opposition
is made to my advance to the position on the Umvolosi,
by which day, the 3rd of July, at noon, the conditions must
be complied with. If my force is fired on, I shall consider
negotiations are at an end, and to avoid any chance of this,
it is best that Mundula come to my camp at daybreak or
to-night, and that the Zulus should withdraw from the
neighbourhood of the river to Ulundi. I cannot stop the
general in command of the coast army until these conditions
are complied with."</p>

<p>Of course, nothing more was seen or heard of Mundula.
On the 2nd of July an impi, 20,000 strong, advanced from
Ulundi as if to attack. Newdigate and Wood, at a short
distance from each other, immediately laagered their
waggons, and these preparations seemed to check the
enemy. It is possible that Cetywayo had personally some
idea of surrendering, as it is stated that a large herd of
white cattle (the royal colour) was seen coming towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the camp from the direction of Cetywayo's new stronghold
at Mahize Kanye. A number of men came out and drove
the cattle back. A sudden scare or panic had just taken
place at the camp. Men of the Native Contingent, having
become alarmed, rushed in over a portion of the 2-4th
Regiment; our short-service red jackets, seeing naked black
men rushing in past them, assegai in hand, imagined that
the Zulus were upon them, and fled in terror within the
laager. So demoralized did the men become, that it
required the exertion of physical force on the part of their
officers to induce them to return to their posts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Preparations for battle.</i></div>

<p>On the 3rd of July a large force of mounted men, under
Colonel Buller, crossed the river at a drift commanded by a
rocky hill, from which the enemy were gallantly and quickly
dislodged by Baker's Irregular Horse. Buller moved forward
to Nodwengu kraal, and on the way several stragglers
were killed. One of them was "stuck" by Lord William
Beresford, with the exclamation, "First spear, by Jove!"
Shortly afterwards this force was nearly trapped, by means
of the decoy of a man with a number of goats, who moved
forward in front. The nonchalance of this fellow was so
suspicious, that the force was suddenly wheeled to the right
in the direction of Ulundi; and no sooner was this done
than a crowd of Zulus, who had been in ambush, rose out
of a donga at a hundred yards distance, and poured in a
heavy volley.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Preparations for battle were made during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the night of the 3rd of July. War-dancing took place
among the enemy, while on our side the waggons were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
carefully formed into laager, and at 6 a.m. on the 4th
of July, the British army, leaving this camp, crossed the
Umvolosi river, and ascending to the high ground, formed
upon it in order of battle. It was here that the Zulus had
defeated the Boers, and it was, therefore, fitting that upon
the field where the white men had met with disaster their
crowning triumph should take place. A victory sufficient
to repair and efface the stains of all previous calamities
was absolutely required, and it was obtained in the most
complete and satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>The leaders of the Zulu army were named Tyingwayo,
Manyamane, Dabulamanzi, Mondula, Sirayo, Mehkla Ka
Zulu. The force under their command numbered more
than thirteen corps of regiments, was larger than that at
Kambula, and comprised more than 20,000 men. One of
the prisoners, named Undungunyanga, son of Umgegane,
declared that it was true the king had wanted to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
peace, and previous to the battle, in an address to the army,
said that as the Inkandampeonvu regiment would not let
the white cattle go to the British as a peace offering, and
as the white army was now at his home, they could fight.
The battle was to take place on the open plain between the
Nodwengu and Ulundi kraals. The king then personally
placed the different regiments, gave final orders, and retired
to a kraal at a short distance to witness the battle.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The
place in which the British army was drawn up had many
advantages. A broad open country was around, almost
free from bush. The Nodwengu kraal, distant about 1000
yards, offered some cover to the enemy, and it would have
been burned had not Colonel Buller suggested that if this
were done the Zulus would be enabled to creep up under
cover of the smoke.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The battle of Ulundi.</i></div>

<p>Very shortly after a halt had been made, and while the
solemn duty of burying one of our men, killed on the
previous day, was taking place, it was observed that the
enemy was approaching from the direction of Ulundi, and
from the bush on the right. Our troops were formed up
in a hollow parallelogram. In the centre was the Native
Contingent, with ammunition waggons. The four sides of
the parallelogram were formed by eight companies of the
13th Regiment, five companies of the 80th Regiment, the
90th, 58th, and 34th Regiments, together with the 17th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Lancers and the mounted irregulars. At the corners and
centres artillery was placed&mdash;Gatlings,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> 7-pounders, and
9-pounders. At half-past 8 a.m., as the enemy were
advancing, Buller's mounted men were thrown out on the
front, left, and rear. As the right was left uncovered by
cavalry, Cochrane's Mounted Basutos were sent out from
this direction to make the enemy advance nearer. As they
retired the right face of the square commenced the action
by a brisk fire. At ten minutes to nine o'clock the attacking
army was so near the British as to make the fire from
the latter become general. Silently and steadily the horns
of the Zulu army came on in their usual manner; without
a word or cry, the warriors of Cetywayo continued to press
forward in spite of the deadly fusillade. As at Ghinghelovo
and Kambula, so now at Ulundi, their extraordinary
bravery and contempt of death was the chief feature in the
attack. During this time the British infantry were formed
in four ranks, of which the front knelt, while the rear rank
was reversed. Inside the square every means of obtaining
ammunition swiftly was provided. The continuous and
tremendous fire poured upon the advancing enemy had no
perceptible effect at first. On, like a wave of the sea which
cannot be stopped, poured the human tide; but when it
had advanced to a distance of seventy yards, flesh and
blood could no longer stand the awful destruction which
poured from the British lines. The main body hesitated
and stopped. A few, more intrepid than the others, rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
on; but the wavering feeling spread throughout the Zulu
host, and now was the exact moment to take advantage of
it. The dogs of war were suddenly slipped. Out rushed
the Lancers, and bore down like a hurricane upon the disheartened
and discouraged multitude. Shells were breaking
in all directions among their masses, the incessant
"pings" of rifle bullets were doing deadly execution; and
when the cavalry plunged in among them, the Zulu army
was literally torn asunder and broken. The flower of these
warriors of Zululand made yet one wild effort, when Captain
Edgell, of the Lancers, was shot dead, and Captain Drury-Lowe,
Lieutenant James, and other officers had a narrow
escape. Nine men were killed, and no fewer than seventy-five
were wounded. But all was in vain; Cetywayo's great
army was forced to turn and fly. They had met the white
man upon the open plain, and, though more than 20,000 to
5000, were totally and completely defeated. Away went
the mounted men in pursuit, and before the slaughter
ended, fully 1000 of the Zulu army bit the dust. The
Lancers, with the Irregular Horse, did very good work, as
it is estimated 450 of the enemy were killed in the pursuit.
The Zulus ran with surprising swiftness. The Lancers
drove a crowd into a donga, and working round, pursued
a mass of fugitives, who, being overtaken and at bay, made
an unavailing stand, when 150 of their number were killed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Total defeat of the Zulus.</i></div>

<p>A rest was ordered after the battle; and then the mounted
force rode on to Ulundi, which was found wholly deserted,
and was at once given to the flames. Subsequently all
the forces fell back upon the laagered camp which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
been left in the morning. Ulundi, the great place of the
great monarch of Southern Africa, was wholly destroyed.
The king's palace consisted merely of a thatched building
of four rooms with a verandah. A Spartan absence of all
furniture and of all luxuries was perceptible, but the
numerous huts and kraals indicated that this place had
been the head-quarters of a powerful army. Lord William
Beresford was the first to enter. It was a grand sight to
see the flames mounting to the skies, and to know that in
their smoke the prestige and influence of the greatest
savage power in Southern Africa had ended. Mr. Archibald
Forbes, the correspondent of the <i>Daily News</i>, although
suffering from a wound, galloped to the colony with the
news of this victory. He carried an important despatch
from the general, and was the first to telegraph the news
to Natal and to the world. Starting early in the forenoon,
immediately after the battle of Ulundi, he rode in fourteen
hours a distance of 110 miles to the nearest telegraph
station at Landman's Drift, on the Buffalo river. Twice he
lost his way in the midst of dense mist, and during the
entire journey he was exposed to attack by scattered
parties of the enemy. It was a daring ride, which will live
in history, and deserved special and generous recognition.</p>

<p>The following is Lord Chelmsford's telegraphic despatch
giving a description of the battle:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cetywayo not having complied with my demands by
noon yesterday, July 3rd, and having fired heavily on the
troops at the water, I returned the 114 cattle he had sent
in, and ordered a reconnaissance to be made by the mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
force under Colonel Buller; this was effectually made, and
caused the Zulu army to advance and show fight.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lord Chelmsford's despatch.</i></div>

<p>"This morning, a force under my command, consisting
of the second division, under Major-General Newdigate,
numbering 1870 Europeans, 530 natives, and eight guns,
and the flying column under Brigadier-General Wood,
numbering 2192 Europeans, 573 natives, four guns, and
two Gatlings, crossed the Umvolosi river at 6.15, and
marching in a hollow square, with the ammunition and
entrenching tool carts and bearer company in its centre,
reached an excellent position between Nodwengu and Ulundi,
about half-past 8 a.m. This had been observed by Colonel
Buller the day before.</p>

<p>"Our fortified camp on the right banks of the Umvolosi
river was left with a garrison of about 900 Europeans, 250
natives, and one Gatling gun, under Colonel Bellairs.</p>

<p>"Soon after half-past seven the Zulu army was seen
leaving its bivouacs and advancing on every side. The
engagement was shortly afterwards commenced by the
mounted men.</p>

<p>"By nine o'clock the attack was fully developed. At half-past
nine the enemy wavered; the 17th Lancers, followed
by the remainder of the mounted men, attacked them, and
a general rout ensued.</p>

<p>"The prisoners state that Cetywayo was personally
commanding and had made all the arrangements himself,
and that he witnessed the fight from Qikarzi kraal, and
that twelve regiments took part in it. If so, 20,000 men
attacked us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is impossible to estimate with any correctness the
loss of the enemy, owing to the extent of country over which
they attacked and retreated, but it could not have been
less, I consider, than 1000 killed. By noon Ulundi was in
flames, and during the day all military kraals of the Zulu
army and in the valley of the Umvolosi were destroyed.
At 2 p.m. the return march to the camp of the column
commenced.</p>

<p>"The behaviour of the troops under my command was
extremely satisfactory; their steadiness under a complete
belt of fire was remarkable. The clash and enterprise of
the mounted branches was all that could be wished, and
the fire of the artillery very good. A portion of the Zulu
force approached our fortified camp, and at one time
threatened to attack it. The Native Contingent, forming
a part of the garrison, were sent out after the action, and
assisted in the pursuit.</p>

<p>"As I have fully accomplished the object for which I
advanced, I consider I shall now be best carrying out Sir
Garnet Wolseley's instructions by moving at once to
Entonganini, and thence to Kwamagaza. I shall send
back a portion of this force with empty waggons, for
supplies, which are now ready at Fort Marshall."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Resignation of Lord Chelmsford.</i></div>

<p>The last paragraph of this despatch requires comment.
A great victory had been gained, and certainly should have
been improved upon. It was known that Cetywayo was
with the army, and subsequent intelligence proved that a
very little effort would have resulted in his capture. The
new kraal of the king was only twelve miles distant, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
if a forward movement had been made to that place, an
enormous advantage, which was merely a logical sequence of
the battle, could have been secured. Sir Garnet Wolseley's
instructions about retiring to Entonganini are quoted, and
he is apparently made responsible for a retrograde step.
Thus was the war still further protracted in an unnecessary
manner. As regards the battle of Ulundi itself,
Lord Chelmsford did not attack, but was attacked. Both
at home and in the colonies, throughout the Empire, there
was a generous thrill of joy among all classes, not only for
the decisive victory, but because it had been gained by a
general who had been previously so unfortunate.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>The beginning of the end had now arrived, and evident
signs were not wanting that the Zulus accepted their defeat
at Ulundi as a settlement of the question of supremacy.
Lord Chelmsford resigned, and proceeded with a large
staff from Entonganini to Pietermaritzburg. On this long
journey he met not the slightest attempt at interruption or
any sign of hostility. No enemy lurked in the Umhlatusi
Bush, and in every direction the Zulus could be seen rebuilding
their huts and cultivating their fields. The sword
was turned into the ploughshare, and the ruling of fate was
submitted to. Still serious doubts filled the minds of old
colonists, who ranked above all their other qualities the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
supreme cunning and dissimulation of the Zulu race. It
was felt as a calamity that no forward move had been made
after Ulundi, and that there was no real finality to the war,
until Cetywayo was either killed or captured.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Banquet at D'Urban.</i></div>

<p>Lord Chelmsford arrived at the capital of Natal on the 21st
of July, and was received there with an enthusiasm which
completely surprised him. Powerful reactions are common
in the public mind, and the general who had yesterday
been severely criticized, was to-day lauded to the skies.
The Corporation presented an address in which it was
made a source of special gratification that, after the
numerous unforeseen difficulties which had to be overcome,
his lordship's arms had obtained a brilliant and decisive
victory. At D'Urban a grand public banquet was given,
when Sir Garnet Wolseley, Sir Henry Bulwer, General
Clifford, Sir Evelyn Wood, Colonel Buller, and all distinguished
officers and citizens were present. Lord
Chelmsford on this occasion said, "There is a saying very
frequently quoted now-a-days, that 'nothing succeeds like
success,' but, gentlemen, if I thought that you asked me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
to dinner simply because I had been successful, it would be
as water from the Dead Sea placed to my mouth; but from
what the Mayor has said, it is clear you sympathize with
me not because I succeeded, but because under circumstances
of extreme difficulty I endeavoured to do my duty.
There have been many painful incidents connected with
the war, so that it is impossible to look back upon it
without mingled feelings of satisfaction and regret. On
this I will not further touch; but there is one point on
which I can look back with pure and unalloyed satisfaction,
already alluded to by my gallant friend General Wood&mdash;I
mean the loyal and efficient assistance given to me by all
ranks in the army, which is such that the satisfaction and
pride that I feel will be remembered as long as I live. I
never could have believed it possible for any general to
receive such assistance and devotion as I have experienced
from my men. I could always feel that, whether I was
present or absent, they were striving to do their best to
get out of difficulties, and this was not confined to one
rank, but was common to all ranks; and I believe I may
say that I had the confidence and sincere support of all
ranks of the army, from the lowest to the highest. It
would be invidious to particularize individuals and services,
but when I look back eighteen months, two names stand
out in broad relief&mdash;those already alluded to, the one by
the Mayor, and the other by General Wood&mdash;the names of
Wood and Buller. I can say that these two have been
my right and left supporters during the whole of my time
in this country. They came out with me in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
steamer; in every position I have been in they have been
in the fore-front, and now I feel proud to think they return
with me to their native land again. The Mayor asked one
question, namely, whether the war was over or not. I
think I can best answer this by saying that these two men
are going back to England; depend upon it, if there were
any great work to be done, these two men would never have
left the forces. I again thank you for the manner in which
you have drank this toast, and desire to include in my
thanks all those who met me on Monday night. I shall
carry back a grateful remembrance of this place; and if in
the public position I shall hold it is ever possible for me
to render any assistance towards the prosperity of the
colony, you may depend upon it I shall do so."</p>

<p class="b1">In concluding this chapter, it seems right to quote fully
from the London <i>Gazette</i> the official reasons for placing
five brave men on the "roll of fame" for gallant deeds
performed in the Zulu war.</p>

<p class="pn70 reduct">"War Office, June 17th.</p>

<p class="pbq">"The Queen has been graciously pleased to signify her
intention to confer the decoration of the Victoria Cross on

viz.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Honour to the brave.</i></div>

<p class="pbq">"Captain and Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Redvers H.

at Zlobane on the 28th of March, 1879, in having assisted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
while hotly pursued by Zulus, in rescuing Captain C. D'Arcy,
of the Frontier Light Horse, who was retiring on foot, and
carrying him on his horse until he overtook the rear-guard.
Also for having, on the same date and under the same
circumstances, conveyed Lieutenant C. Everitt, of the
Frontier Light Horse, whose horse had been killed under
him, to a place of safety. Later on Colonel Buller, in the
same manner, saved a trooper of the Frontier Light Horse,
whose horse was completely exhausted, and who otherwise
would have been killed by the Zulus, who were within
eighty yards of him.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Major William K. Leet, 1st Battalion, 18th Regiment,
for his gallant conduct on the 28th of March, 1879, in
rescuing from the Zulus Lieutenant A. M. Smith, of the
Frontier Light Horse, during the retreat from the Zlobane.
Lieutenant Smith, while on foot, his horse having been
shot, was closely pursued by the Zulus, and would have
been killed, had not Major Leet taken him upon his horse
and rode with him, under the fire of the enemy, to a place
of safety.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Surgeon-Major James Henry Reynolds, Army Medical

going and returning.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Lieutenant Edward S. Browne, 1st Battalion, 24th Regiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
for the gallant conduct on the 29th of March, 1879,
when the Mounted Infantry were being driven in by the

taken by the enemy, Private Wassall retreated towards the
Buffalo river, in which he saw a comrade struggling and

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pni05">LORD CHELMSFORD'S POLICY&mdash;PROMPTNESS AND DECISION
OF SIR GARNET WOLSELEY&mdash;THE HUNT AND CAPTURE
OF CETYWAYO&mdash;DEPARTURE FROM NATAL&mdash;THE LAST
OF THE ZULU KINGS A PRISONER IN THE CASTLE OF
CAPE TOWN&mdash;GREAT MEETING WITH ZULU CHIEFS&mdash;SIR
GARNET WOLSELEY'S SPEECH&mdash;SETTLEMENT OF
THE COUNTRY&mdash;END OF THE WAR.</p>

<p class="pn p2">Before leaving the shores of South Africa, Lord Chelmsford
took occasion at Cape Town to make a public defence
of his policy, in which he denied that he had been guilty of
hesitation and vacillation. His mind was made up at a
very early date, and he went on unswervingly to Ulundi by
the route he had originally resolved upon. If the work
were to be done over again he would adopt the same plan
of campaign. In marching upon Ulundi no calculation
was made for assistance from the coast column&mdash;only
indirect support was reckoned upon. After the crushing
defeat at Ulundi no advantage would have been gained by
endeavouring to penetrate the difficult country lying north
of the king's kraal, even had the state of supplies permitted
it. "While, therefore, one portion of the force retraced its
steps towards the Blood river, escorting the sick and
wounded, and taking with it all the empty waggons, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
others moved <i>viâ</i> Kwamagwasa to St. Paul's, and then
completed the chain of strongly entrenched posts extending
east and west along the centre of Zululand at intervals of
about twenty miles. So far one side of the question. On
the other hand, men of unquestioned ability and experience,
correspondents for several of the leading journals of
the world, did not hesitate to blame Lord Chelmsford
severely. These men were on the spot, were qualified to
form an opinion, and it is absurd and unjust to imagine
that political bias of any sort guided their pens.</p>

<p>The <i>Times'</i> correspondent complains of the want of a
definite plan, and speaks of orders having been countermanded,
and of general uncertainty. "What is wanted is
a bolder determination." On the 16th of June he writes,
"We are wandering towards Ulundi much as the children
of Israel wandered towards Canaan, without plans
or even definite notions for the future. Plain, common-sense
plans suffice, if backed by energy, decision, and
determination." The <i>Telegraph's</i> correspondent tells us that
Lord Chelmsford's intelligence department "has been
singularly defective throughout." The correspondent of
the <i>Daily News</i>, Mr. Archibald Forbes, thoroughly shared
these opinions, and expresses them with conspicuous power
and ability. Indeed, it is almost impossible for any one
to study carefully the proceedings of this protracted campaign,
from the arrival of reinforcements in March until the
battle of Ulundi, and not come to conclusions by no means
complimentary to the general commanding-in-chief. It is
urged that carriers, such as those employed by Sir Garnet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Wolseley immediately after his arrival,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> would have immensely
facilitated transport, and when we consider that
4000 British troops at Ulundi defeated, in the open field,
the concentrated power of Cetywayo&mdash;an army of more
than 20,000 men&mdash;it is hard to believe that a column such
as Wood's, properly reinforced and moving quickly, would
not have been able to finish the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Sir Garnet Wolseley.</i></div>

<p>Sir Garnet Wolseley's proceedings were of the most
prompt and vigorous character. Disappointed in not being
able to land at Port Durnford, he had to return to D'Urban
and proceed overland to General Crealock's coast column.
When near the coast, he was gratified by receiving news of
the battle of Ulundi, but was subsequently disappointed at
Lord Chelmsford's neglecting to take full advantage of this
victory. That officer almost immediately resigned, and
had an interview with Sir Garnet, whom he met at St.
Paul's. A Ulundi column was organized under Lieutenant-Colonel
Clarke, consisting of the 60th Regiment, Barrow's
Mounted Infantry, two troops of Lonsdale's Horse, and two
troops of the Native Contingent. This small movable
column was ordered to operate towards the upper waters of
the White and Black Umvolosi; Oham, with a burgher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
force, was to move from Luneberg. On the 21st of July
Sir Garnet had a satisfactory interview with the principal
Zulu chiefs. Dabulamanzi, the king's brother and one of
the chief leaders of his army, had surrendered at Fort
Chelmsford (Crealock's column) on the 11th of July, and
numbers of minor chiefs, with their people, came forward
to declare their submission to the British Government.
Colonel Baker Russell was directed to operate from Intabankawa,
in the direction of the Black Umvolosi, lending
assistance to Oham, whose forces were situated in a more
northerly direction. Under Colonel Villiers it was arranged
that the Swazis should cross the Pongolo, accompanied by
Political Agent Macleod. As Sir Garnet considered that
there were more troops in the command than were necessary,
the first division and cavalry brigade were broken
up. Generals Crealock and Marshall went home. The
1-13th, 1-24th, and 17th Lancers were ordered to leave,
and several colonial corps were disbanded. Brigadier-General
Wood and Colonel Buller required rest, and proceeded
to England, while the Marines who arrived by the
<i>Jumna</i>, from Plymouth, were sent back before even they
reached Natal.</p>

<p>The chase of Cetywayo must always form an interesting
episode in British colonial history. No war in Zululand
could be said to be thoroughly at an end in which the
despot whose will was law throughout the entire country
was left uncaptured. The task of securing his person was
a very difficult one. The king was looked upon as sacred,
and we shall see that the most unbounded loyalty was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
manifested towards him. The country into which he had
retreated was broken and difficult, intersected by forests
and unprovided with roads. Above all, the people were
thoroughly hostile, and faithful unto death to the monarch
who was pursued to death by the hated white man.
Nevertheless, the chase was successful, and that it was so
reflected immense credit upon those engaged in it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hunting Cetywayo.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Capture of the king's people.</i></div>

<p>The force told off for the duty was organized at Ulundi.
It was placed under the command of Major Barrow, and
comprised the King's Dragoon Guards, the Mounted Infantry,
Lonsdale's Horse, Captain Norse's Mounted Contingent,
Jantje's Horse under Captain Hayes, together with
a corps of Guides under Corporal Acutt. The hunt lasted
fourteen days, and commenced on a Tuesday afternoon with
a forced march of twenty-one hours, during the whole of
which time the men were in the saddle. In this manner
Zonyamma's kraal was reached, where it was supposed the
king might be. The king had left the day previously with
thirty men. Two hours' rest, and away over very hilly
country. A terribly steep hill was descended, and a kraal
visited where Cetywayo had been that morning. The
river Mona was then crossed, and a steep hill ascended in
order to reach Umbopa's kraal, where the scent was entirely
lost. Of course, the Zulus knew where the king was, but
nothing on earth would induce them to tell. Umbopa
(whose son was with Cetywayo) was then made prisoner
and taken to his son's kraal, at a distance of five miles,
where some of the king's slaughter oxen were found.
The kraal was deserted. Lord Gifford, second in com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>mand,
was then ordered to scour the country, and had a
very exciting but unsuccessful chase after a naked Zulu,
who afterwards turned out to be one of the king's servants,
appointed to look out and give warning of the approach of
pursuers. Forty Zulus were got together by Major Barrow,
but neither promises nor threats had any effect upon them.
They were as loyal to their sable ruler as a faithful Highlander
to his chief, or a loyal Cavalier to his king. At last
it was accidentally mentioned that one of Cetywayo's own
servants was present. With great difficulty some information
was obtained from him, and a promise to put the
British force on the right track. At the dawn of day the
dense black forests of the Umvolosi were entered, and as
they proceeded pots and calabashes, evidently dropped in
flight, were picked up. On&mdash;on until the river was reached,
but there, alas! the trail was completely wanting. A few
"koodoos" quietly grazing was the only sign of life. Lord
Gifford was then sent to Funwayo's kraal, eight miles
distant, and there information was obtained that some
of the king's girls had been seen passing that way. Five
miles further on was Shemana's kraal, where the same party
were again heard of. Pushing through thick bush and
long grass, in which the small band under Lord Gifford&mdash;only
eleven in number&mdash;could very easily have been cut off,
they got at length to a kraal, where they again heard of
the girls. Thence, taking two men as guides, they proceeded
further, taking care to make for the open country, in
order to intercept Cetywayo in case he endeavoured to reach
the Inkanhla forest. At last they reached Umgitya's kraal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
from whence they could overlook the bush in which they
supposed the king to be. Disappointment then met them
on every side, only relieved by the encounter with the two
girls who, in spite of emphatic denials, there was every reason
to believe were the property of the king. One of the king's
own servants was shortly afterwards captured, and inside
his bundle was found a valuable Martini-Henry rifle of
excellent workmanship. Subsequently, this prisoner confessed
that he had left the king only two or three days
previously. A day's rest was then taken, and while
encamped, seven girls, a young man, and a boy were
caught, who reported that Cetywayo was captured, and
that they had fled from his place two days before. It
then turned out that when the pursuing party was encamped
on the banks of the Black Umvolosi, they were
only within 300 yards of the king, some of whose people
ran away, thinking that his capture was certain. Next day
they commenced to scour the bush. There they had to
sleep, while Zulu beef and Zulu beer were their fare.
Most of the party at this time thought the game was up,
but Lord Gifford was still full of hope. Back they went,
beating the bush on the way, to Umbopa's son's place,
where the kraal was burned and the cattle captured. The
main body was shortly afterwards reached, and there, at
last, rather precise information was obtained from a Zulu
"by means of proper persuasive measures." This man
was to act as guide, but no sooner had they entered the
bush than he slipped off and escaped. Two places which
had evidently been prepared for the king were seen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the party had to return again to the kraals, which had now
become head-quarters.</p>

<p>Two of Oham's men came in professing their loyalty,
and were appointed spies, but a little boy revealed the fact
that one of them had been with the king down in the bush,
and then, before all the people, they were told that their
double-dealing and humbug were perfectly understood.
Trails were followed, people were examined, but all to no
purpose; fealty to the king was paramount. Neither the
loss of their cattle, which were carried off, the fear of death,
nor the offer of bribes, immense in value to them, were of
any avail. Returning from one of their long exploring
expeditions, a woman was suddenly met in the bush,
whose fright at the sight of the white men and the guns
was so great as to make her confess the place where the
king had slept two nights previously. A party went off at
dusk to this place, and captured three brothers, who being
questioned, under fear of death, declared that they knew
nothing, and that if killed they would die innocently. In
the dark forest, lit up by the moon and the bright glare of
the bivouac fire, the three men stood before their captors.
It was a subject worthy of the pencil of Salvator Rosa.
Interrogatories, threats, promises, all were useless, until
at last the plan was adopted of leading one of the brothers
away blindfolded behind a bush, and causing a rifle to be
fired off in such a way as to induce the others to believe
that he was shot. At last, overcome by fear, one of them
told where the king had slept the night before, and where
he had seen him that morning. The other brother, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
informed that everything was known, confirmed the intelligence.
Away went Lord Gifford and his party, with
these two men as guides, and at daybreak the kraal was
reached and found deserted. The direction that Cetywayo
had taken was then pointed out, and having been followed
to one of Umnyamna's kraals, it was then discovered that
the king was only five miles distant, and had halted for
the day. It was then absolutely necessary to surround
the place without being seen, particularly as his refuge
was close by the side of a forest, into which, upon the
slightest alarm, he would immediately escape. As it was
known that the Dragoons had gone some distance beyond
this place, a note was sent by Lord Gifford to Major Marter,
telling him to watch the passes. The latter officer, upon
questioning the Zulu, ascertained where the king was,
and immediately made such dispositions as to render
escape impossible. The kraal was surrounded before
Cetywayo had the slightest idea that his pursuers were
upon him. The men of the Natal Native Contingent called
upon him to surrender, but no notice was taken of this
summons. Upon Major Marter repeating it, the king
came out. The natives stretched out their hands towards
him, but with dignity the monarch of the Zulus waved
them back, and surrendered to Major Marter, accompanying
his submission with a request that he might be immediately
shot. He was informed, in reply, that if no resistance were
made his person was perfectly safe. Then there was
mounting in hot haste, and, under the escort of Major
Marter's party, the king, with four of his women, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
hurried away towards Ulundi. From that place an
ambulance with eight mules was sent out, on the morning
of the 29th of August, to proceed to the Black Umvolosi
river and convey him thence. The king complained of the
jolting, and walked a good deal of the way.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Cetywayo captured.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Major Marter's narrative.</i></div>

<p>The authority for the preceding account is Mr. Lysight,
interpreter with Lord Gifford's party. The following is
the interesting narrative of the capture given by Major
Marter. That officer left Colonel Clarke's column at the
Black Umvolosi at daylight on Wednesday the 27th, in
consequence of news coming in from General Colley that
the king was making for the Ignome forest. He had with
him his squadron King's Dragoon Guards, one company
of Barton's natives under Captain Plesh, ten Mounted
Irregulars under Lieutenant Wingh, and young Oftenbro
as interpreter, with four scouts or guides. He sent his men
on to threaten the inhabitants of the kraals that unless
they gave him information about the king and helped to
catch him, he had orders to burn their kraals, take prisoners,
capture cattle, and not allow them to cultivate any
land until he was caught. At last he got an indirect hint,
after sleeping out one night, from a Zulu whom he met,
named Uzililo, who stated that he had come from Umbopa's
kraal, and had heard that the "wind blew that way," pointing
to where the king was afterwards taken, but that the
troops had better go "that way," pointing further to the
north-east, so as to get there well. This was enough for the
major, and having also met Gifford's messenger with the
note to Captain Maurice, who was not near, and opened it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
in which it spoke of his being on the track again, and that he
expected to capture the king that night, he felt sure he was
also on the track and would try and assist at the capture.
He went on carefully up the hill, until near the top he
came to a kraal, when, in answer to a question for guides,
two men started off without speaking or answering any
questions, and took their guests to the top of the Ignome
forest, at a place with precipitous edges looking down
nearly 1500 feet. They came to a small open space with
long grass, and here the guides put up their hands, and
the party was halted. From this point only Major Marter
and his interpreter proceeded on hands, knees, and stomach,
imitating their guides, until fifty yards further on they
could look down and see a small kraal of about twenty huts
strongly stockaded, standing on a slight rise in the centre,
surrounded by forest-covered steep slopes on three sides,
and only open towards the south-west. This was the place
where the king was then, and a plan was quickly arranged
to surround it. The natives were stripped of all their clothes
to the skin, and taking only their rifles, assegais, and
cartridges, were to proceed down the left slope, and get
round quietly in front and across the opening, so as to be
in time to co-operate with the Dragoons, who were to dismount
and lead their horses down, as best they could, any
place which was found at all accessible. The men were all
dismounted, and after a little search a place was found
where they could get into a little ravine and so work them
very carefully to the bottom. The major led, and left the
top at 1.45, reaching the bottom at 3 p.m., with the loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
of two horses and several men injured. They all say it
was most horrible work, all thick forest, with rocky boulders
to jump down sometimes several feet. However, "all's
well that ends well," and the end was worth the means; so,
luckily, as there was a slight rise hiding them from the
kraal, which was only 600 yards distant, they managed to
mount again <i>en masse</i>, and then, directing Captain Gibbing's
troops to file off to the right, and Godsden's to the left,
they charged at the kraal full gallop, and surrounded it
before the people inside knew they were there. Fortunately,
also, the natives first got across the open, but at the same
time others completely hemmed them in. It was seen that
all the men inside were armed; but they were at once
warned that if a shot was fired they would be fired into all
round, and the kraal burnt, so they unwillingly submitted.
Major Marter dismounted, and, followed by his interpreter
and some Dragoons, went in and demanded where the king
was. Umkozana, the last chief who remained with the
king, pointed to a hut at the other end, and they went
there at once and told Cetywayo to come out. He refused,
asked them to come in to him, wanted to know the rank of
the officer in charge, and then requested them to shoot
him. After some useless parleying, and as it was foolish
to lose time, he was threatened that unless he came out
they would burn the kraal, and not until then did he come
out. The first thing he said was that they would never
have caught him if they had not come down the mountains,
as he had spies on the flats, and thought it quite impossible
for any troops but Zulus to come down the precipices at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the back. He was told his life would be spared, but that
he must go along with them as a prisoner to the white
chief at Ulundi. They captured, besides the king and
Umkozana, the headman of the kraal, six men-servants
and one boy, and five women and one girl; also four
Martini-Henry's, lots of cartridges, fourteen other guns,
and many relics of the 24th Regiment, with a lot of the
king's cooking and sleeping things. The king caused much
intentional delay by walking as slowly as he could.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Cetywayo a prisoner.</i></div>

<p>In entering Ulundi six of the Dragoon Guards rode
in front, followed by Natal Native Contingent men and one
company of the 60th Regiment; then two Dragoon Guards,
between whom walked Cetywayo, with another Dragoon
close behind him. Natal Native Contingent, eight men
of Lonsdale's Horse, and another company of the 60th
Regiment followed. Sir Garnet Wolseley did not go out
to meet the last of the Zulu kings, as the prisoner had
rejected and despised every overture. He was treated, not
as a captured king, but as a mere fugitive from law and
order. After a very short delay, the party again started,
ostensibly for Pietermaritzburg <i>viâ</i> Rorke's Drift; but the
march had not proceeded long, when an express messenger
galloped up from the general with an order to proceed with
all speed to Fort Durnford. When Cetywayo arrived at
Kwamagwaza, he said, "This is not the way to the
Tugela," and knew at once that he would have to cross
the sea. He became melancholy and abstracted. During
the entire journey, he retained the quiet dignity for which
he is remarkable. At Port Durnford a surf-boat was ready,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
into which the king and his party were placed and taken
to the steamer <i>Natal</i>, which was waiting.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The sea was
rough, and Cetywayo had to crawl on his hands and knees
on board, while one of his people, overcome by the terrors
of the ocean, lay on his back in the surf-boat, and made
signs that he desired to be killed. The gunboat <i>Forester</i>
escorted the <i>Natal</i> to Simon's Bay, and thence to Table
Bay, where Cetywayo and his wives were landed, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
lodged in the castle of Cape Town. Thus ended in a prison
in the metropolis of the Cape Colony the career of the last
of the Zulu kings and the autonomy of the nation. The
greatest and most powerful ruler of South Africa had defied
Great Britain, and in his defeat fell once and for ever all
the hopes of domination so long cherished among the native
tribes of Southern Africa.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Cetywayo's personal appearance.</i></div>

<p>In spite of his large proportions, Cetywayo is a handsome
man, of much dignity of aspect. His limbs are
large, but symmetrical; very broad chest, large and
lustrous eyes, intelligent and not unamiable countenance.
With plenty of food and perfect safety, he lost all inclination
to be shot. Speaking of the war, he took all the
responsibility for the battle of Kambula, but declared that
Ulundi was fought against his wish, and in consequence
of the determination of his young men once more to try
the arbitration of the sword. Now that his power is
broken, he laughs to scorn the idea of any more fighting
being possible against British rule.</p>

<p>A great meeting was called by the white "inkosi" (Sir
Garnet) for the 1st of September&mdash;the same day, six years
ago, on which Cetywayo was crowned. It was fitting that
the anniversary of the day of promises never fulfilled should
be also a day of atonement. Two hundred Zulus were
seated a few paces from Sir Garnet's tent, and although
naturally great talkers, the silence of death prevailed.
Ranged in rows four deep, with the principal chiefs in
front, they listened with perfect attention to the words
which decided the fate of their country and of themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Two of the king's brothers and the prime minister of the
king were present. At half-past four, Sir Garnet Wolseley
left his tent, and, as he walked towards the assembly,
was greeted with uplifted hands and shouts of "Inkose."
Leaning upon the hilt of his sword, he calmly gazed for
a few moments upon the representatives of a conquered
nation assembled to hear its doom. Mr. Shepstone interpreted
into Zulu sentence by sentence as Sir Garnet
Wolseley spoke, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Sir Garnet Wolseley and the Zulus.</i></div>

<p>"It is six years ago on this very day, the 1st of September,
that Cetywayo was crowned King of the Zulus, and
only yesterday you yourselves have seen him carried away
a prisoner, never to return again to Zululand. On the
occasion of his coronation Cetywayo made certain promises
regarding laws to be observed in the future, which promises
he never fulfilled, and his country is now about
to be divided into different chieftainships, and I hope his
fate will be a warning to all of the chiefs not to follow in
his footsteps, but to act according to the commands and
terms given by the English Queen, who will most certainly
punish any who do not do so. The interests and welfare
of the South African races are very dear to the Queen, and
she is anxious that the natives of this country should
thrive, as those in Natal have done up to the present time.
She will be lenient to faults arising from ignorance; but
although inclined, as I have said, to deal leniently when
ignorance causes them to commit faults, those who persistently
go contrary to good government and peace will
assuredly be punished as Cetywayo has been. As they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
are aware, she lives far away; but her power is very great,
and she is quite able to, and will, punish those who take
life or make wars contrary to her orders. Cetywayo took
the lives of his people for trivial offences, without giving
them a chance of defending themselves, or allowing them
a fair trial. This must cease. In future, trivial offences
will be punishable by fines. Cetywayo kept on foot a large
and powerful army, and did not allow his men to marry
without his permission; in future, the young men will be
allowed to marry when and whom they like, provided
always they have sufficient for the support of a wife, and
the consent of the girl's parents. Disobedience of this
law is to be punishable by a fine inflicted by the headmen
of the kraal. As Zululand is almost entirely surrounded
by country under the Queen of England's rule, and not
threatened in any way, there is no need of a larger army;
and in future no guns or ammunition will be allowed to be
imported, or to be in the hands of any Zulu. Nor will any
stores be permitted to be landed on the Zulu coast, in case,
under the guise of merchandise, arms should be brought
into the country. The young men are to be encouraged
to labour, and are to be allowed to come and leave when
they like; for only by work can they become rich and
prosperous. Cetywayo encouraged witchcraft, and what
is known as 'smelling out.' That I look to the chiefs to
put down, and an end to such ridiculous and foolish
practices arrived at. Cetywayo, by this practice of witchcraft,
caused many lives to be taken, and neither life nor
property was safe. And each chief must clearly understand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
before he signs his name to the treaty, that none
of his people must be taken without a fair trial before the
chief being granted, and the accused being allowed to call
his witnesses. In what I have said there is nothing new,
though the young men may have forgotten; but these laws
and customs held good before Chaka's ancient laws and
usages introduced what is known as the military system.
I intend leaving an English officer here as Resident, to
be the eyes and ears of England, to watch over the people,
to see the laws observed, and that the chiefs rule with
justice and equity. I am aware there are still a considerable
number of rifles and guns of ours, as well as
cattle scattered about the country, and those chiefs who
wish to stand well with the English Queen will lose no time
in bringing them in and delivering them up to the British
Resident.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>General Crealock's column.</i></div>

<p>"As they are well aware by their own rules of war
and conquest, Zululand now belongs to the Queen of
England. She has, however, already enough land in
Africa, and so she has, through me as her representative,
appointed certain chiefs to rule over districts which I shall
presently name. The chiefs elected must remember that
this is an act of grace, and that what I am now doing
in partitioning the country to various chiefs is only what
Cetywayo has himself done in former times. They are
well aware our laws, religion, and customs are very
different to theirs, and the Queen has no wish to force
ours upon them. As regards the laws and customs they
are to be ruled by, they are to be those good and ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
ones in use before Chaka's time; but life and property
is to be protected, and no life to be forfeited without a fair
trial. As regards religion, there is no wish to force ours
upon them, and missionary enterprise will not be encouraged
contrary to the wish of the chief and people he proposes
to reside amongst. The British Government is very
anxious to prevent white people settling in the country,
and no sale, transfer, or alienation of land will be permitted
or recognized. I consider this a very important point, as
in many instances land has been said by white people to
have been purchased by them from the Zulus, and given
rise to very serious complications. If, therefore, missionaries
do come and wish to reside among the people,
all that can be permitted them to hold in land must be
a small patch for their house and garden, but none whatever
must be alienated from the Zulu people, to whom
it really belongs. Some of those I have intended to make
chiefs, I am sorry to see, are not here to-day; but some
who are here to-day will now sign a document, the purport
of which I have now told you all; and a duplicate of the
treaty will be given to each chief to keep, and a similar
one retained by me. The boundaries of the various chieftainships
will be told them, and will be clearly defined
hereafter by officers sent round for that purpose."</p>

<p class="b1">The first division, or coast column, under General Crealock,
had not been opposed by the Zulus in the field. It
established a series of fortified posts along the south coast
of Zululand, opened a new base of supplies at Port Durnford,
from which to feed a force operating against Ulundi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
destroyed the military kraal of Emangwene and the king's
old military kraal at Ondini, besides clearing the coast
district. By the 6th of July, all the great Zulu chiefs, with
their people, from the Tugela river to St. Lucia Bay, had
given in their submission. It was the coast column, under
Pearson, which gained the battle of Inyezane, and had
gallantly held Ekowe for three months; and it was the
coast column, more than any other, which had suffered
from disease. Among General Crealock's valedictory remarks
are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn70 reduct">"July 17, 1879.</p>

<p class="pbq b1">"In notifying to the army in South Africa that Brigadier-General
Wood, V.C., C.B., and Lieutenant-Colonel
Buller are about to leave Zululand for England, Sir
Garnet Wolseley desires to place on record his high appreciation
of the services they have rendered, and that
their military abilities and untiring energy have materially
tended to bring the war to an end. The success which
has attended the operations of the flying column is largely
due to General Wood's genius for war, to the admirable
system which he has established in his command, and to
the zeal and energy with which his ably conceived plans
have been carried out by Colonel Buller."</p>

<p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Brigadier-General Wood's Orders.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>General Wood's farewell.</i></div>

<p class="pbq p1">"The Brigadier-General proposes, weather permitting,
to leave for Pietermaritzburg to-morrow. In saying good-bye
to the soldiers of all ranks, he wishes to express his
warm gratitude for the support he has invariably received.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
The Brigadier-General has gained the commendation of
his superiors for the successful operations of the flying
column; he feels that the credit he has so obtained has
been gained by the courage and untiring devotion to duty
of his fellow-soldiers, and he will never forget his comrades
of the flying column."</p>

<p class="p1">It is right to quote the following orders respecting two
distinguished officers of the war:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The troops and Naval Brigade forming the first division
must be content with the conviction that their gallantry
in the earlier part of this war has probably
diminished the opposition of the Zulus in this country.</p>

<p>"You must be content with the honest conviction that
your hard work and energy, under very great difficulties,
and with your ranks thinned day by day with sickness and
fever, has successfully carried out the task set you by Lord
Chelmsford to perform; and, thanks to the valuable assistance
and co-operation of Commodore Richards and the
Naval Brigade, you have established the landing-place
opened at Port Durnford, which will enable further operations
towards the capital to be carried out with facility
should they become necessary.</p>

<p>"Soldiers and sailors of the first division, I thank you
all for your good conduct, your hard works; and sympathize
with you in the loss of so many comrades whose
lives have been sacrificed to this climate, so deadly to
man and beast. We have all had great difficulties to overcome.</p>

<p>"I wish you all a hearty 'good-bye;' I wish you success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
and prosperity wherever your duty to her Majesty may
lead you."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Zululand and the new chiefs.</i></div>

<p>It would be uninteresting to go into details with respect
to the movements of the columns under Colonels Villiers
and Baker Russell. Mahabolin and other Magulisin chiefs
surrendered, Manyonyoba asked terms of the commanding
officer at Luneberg, and the various scattered embers left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
after the great war conflagration were soon extinguished
in the north. In September Zululand was most thoroughly
conquered. On the 1st of September, John Dunn, Umgayna,
Usibilo, Umcitsobu, Somkelu, and Gonzi signed
the terms upon which they accepted chieftainship; Oham
and others were proclaimed at a later date. The principal
undertakings and conditions were that the chiefs should
respect the boundaries assigned; abolish the military
system; allow all men to marry and work as they will;
prohibit importation of arms; take no life without fair
trial; discontinue witchcraft; surrender fugitive criminals
from British territory; make no war without the sanction
of Government; prevent sale or alienation of land; arbitration
to be appealed to in case of disputes with British
subjects. The succession to chieftainships to be dependent
on approval of our Government.</p>

<p>The following is an exact summary of the terms and
conditions signed in duplicate by all the newly appointed
chiefs in Zululand at Ulundi, September 1, 1879. The
prelude and ending are verbatim; terms and conditions
summarized:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1">I recognize the victory of British arms over the Zulu
nation and the full right and title of her Majesty Queen
Victoria, Queen of England and Empress of India, to
deal as she may think fit with the Zulu chiefs and the
people, and with the Zulu country; and I agree and
hereby signify my agreement to accept from General Sir

through the Resident of the division in which his territory
is situated.</p>

<p class="pbq">2. Not to permit the existence of the Zulu military
system or the existence of any military system or organisation
whatsoever within my territory; to proclaim and
make it a rule that all men shall be allowed to marry when

ancient customs of his people known and followed in the
days preceding the establishment by Chaka of the military

them with heavy fine or such other punishment as may be
allowed.</p>

<p class="pbq">4. Not to allow life to be taken on any pretence without

<p class="p1">On the 12th of September Major-General Clifford was

who was appointed to act as Resident in Zululand.
Mongodhla had been driven from his caves and his cattle
captured, while his brother had surrendered at Luneburg.
Two companies of the 24th Regiment, ordered to encamp at
Isandhlwana, removed the last vestiges of the camp, buried
any bodies remaining above ground, and erected cairns of
stones over the graves of the troops who fell there. More
than 5000 guns had been taken, or surrendered by Zulus.
Sir Garnet Wolseley did his work thoroughly. Troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
were despatched against Sekukuni, and Sir Garnet himself
proceeded to the Transvaal, in order to subdue discontent
among the inhabitants, and establish a settled system of
government. It is not necessary to follow him there.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>John Dunn.</i></div>

<p class="b1">With the conclusion of the Zulu war this book must terminate.
As regards the political adjustment of affairs in Zululand,
the directions of the Home Government, were no doubt,
implicitly obeyed. The country was made self-supporting
in a military point of view, and the chiefs, with their tribes,
were so disposed as to form a barrier against hostile aggression.
John Dunn, who was a Christian renegade, living as
a Zulu in polygamic life, but whose influence was supreme
throughout the country, was placed as chief over South-Eastern
Zululand. One of his first steps was the prohibition
of all missionaries in the country in which he holds
sway. Over Sirayo's country near the border, extending to
the foot of the Drakenberg, the chief Hlubi was appointed,
about whose tried fidelity and loyalty there can be no question.
Oham occupies the region between the Pongolo and
the Black Umvolosi. Mnyame, the late king's prime minister,
is established near him, and, it is to be hoped, will
not hatch plots for the establishment of Oham on the
throne of his brother. "Zululand for the Zulus" has been
the motto for this arrangement, but hopeless heathenism
has been riveted as chains upon the people. Missionary
enterprise is discouraged and even forbidden, while all the
evils of tribal rule are virtually perpetuated. It has been
said with some fancy, but great exactitude, that the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
dispensation realizes the description of the country given
by Tennyson in "Locksley Hall"&mdash;</p>

Polygamy receives approval. Missionaries are forbidden;
and, strange to say, all this is really done in consequence of
the efforts of the Exeter Hall zealots, who have denounced

lauded the heathens, and strenuously objected to any assumption
of their territory. The toleration of heathenism
is both a blunder and a crime, which, if not stopped in

<p class="pn center large">CAPE COLONISTS <i>VERSUS</i> NATIVES.</p>

<p class="pn center">(<i>Articles published in the P.E. Telegraph.</i>)</p>

<h3 class="p1">I.</h3>

<p class="pn p1">It is an axiom that history repeats itself, and historical studies,
therefore, become particularly useful in a political crisis like the
present, when the policy of Sir Bartle Frere towards the native
tribes of South Africa has been condemned by the Home Government.
In all parts of the world a tragedy is enacted when barbarism
and civilization come into contact. It was so with the
Puritans, whose pioneers landed in North America from the <i>Mayflower</i>;
it is so with the Dutch and the natives of Java, with the
British and the Maoris, with the French and the people of New
Caledonia. Wherever, throughout the world, colonization takes
place among savages there must be war, or there can be no safety
or progress. When the Dutch formed a settlement on the shores
of Table Bay in 1652, it was neither their interest nor their wish
to fight, but it was perfectly impossible to avoid it. Although a
mere place of call for outward and homeward-bound ships was
required, yet it soon became apparent that not merely as a sequence
of successful defence, but as a means of protection, it was requisite
to annex conquered territory. The Hottentots were the first
enemies of Europeans in South Africa, and the Kafirs&mdash;themselves
aggressors&mdash;were the second. The latter people were robbers by
profession, and an organized system of plunder continually harassed
the border farmers of the colony.</p>

<p>The first act of the present tragedy of Kafir war waged against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Great Britain took place in 1811, when constant depredations on
the part of the Kafirs made it necessary either to repel the enemy
or to abandon the country. The latter system of tactics was not
then in vogue among the countrymen of Nelson and Wellington,
therefore a large force under Colonel Graham was despatched to
the front. Landdrost Stockenstrom, who accompanied this force,
rode up to a party of the natives and urgently endeavoured to
secure peace. In reply he was stabbed to death, and fourteen of
the men who accompanied him were likewise murdered. Of course
the Kafirs were chastised, but the snake was only scotched, not
killed, and in 1816 the colonial frontier farmers were so plundered
by the natives that they were forced to state to Government that
they would have to abandon their farms unless effectively protected.
As a result, Lord Charles Somerset held a solemn conference
with Gaika and other great chiefs in April, 1817, which
was followed by a solemn treaty of peace. Those solemn farces
must have been sources of immense amusement to the savages.
Gaika gave pledges with the utmost readiness&mdash;there was no
difficulty whatever. Honesty and justice were in future to prevail;
the people of the kraal to which stolen cattle were traced
should always be held responsible, and reparation was always to
be made <i>instanter</i>. Presents were lavished upon the "Paramount"
Chief, and then (in the words of the Rev. Mr. Williams) "Gaika
fled instantly to the other side of the Kat river like a thief,"
plundering was soon vigorously recommenced, and the idea of
restitution became almost as great a joke as the treaty of peace.
In 1818 the chief T'Slambie positively refused to restore cattle
traced to his kraal. Afterwards, to gain time, he promised, and
then, of course, broke his promise. War was once more forced
upon the authorities, and this time the contest was a serious one.
While military operations were going on in Kafirland, the confederate
chiefs got behind our forces, drove in the small military
posts, and ravaged the frontier districts. Incited to fanaticism
by the witch-doctor Mokanna, or Lynx, 9000 savages impetuously
attacked the head-quarters of the military at Graham's Town, and
it was only by means of desperate fighting that the town was saved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Soon afterwards another solemn treaty was made, in which it was
agreed that all Kafirs should evacuate the country between the
Great Fish and Keiskamma rivers, and that this territory should
remain neutral and unoccupied. The usual sequence occurred, the
treaty was laughed at and violated by our enemies at the earliest
possible moment. Downing Street invariably looked upon the
Kafirs in the light of honourable belligerents, and the unfortunate
colonists as grasping, unscrupulous men. An outrageous divorce
was constituted between truth and justice on the one side, and
so-called philanthropy on the other, and the people of the Cape
Colony had to suffer the heavy and bitter penalties of this extraordinary
ignorance and fatuity. The course of events from first to
last has been very simple. It must be borne in mind that the
South African Kafir wars constitute <i>one</i> tragedy in various acts,
with intervals of unequal duration. The war with Cetywayo is
identical in principle with those waged with Gaika, T'Slambie,
Dingaan, Kreli, and Sandilli. By immense exertions the tide of
savagery has been periodically rolled back, and if wise counsel had
been followed, the war of 1835 would have been final; but
Downing Street intervened, and it is to the disastrous fatuous
policy then adopted that we owe the wars of 1846 and 1852. It
is to this intervention, and to this policy, that we desire in this
article, and in others that are to follow, specially to draw attention,
because the part taken by Sir Benjamin D'Urban in 1836 is now
filled by Sir Bartle Frere in 1879; and the character of Lord
Glenelg, who declared that "the Kafirs had ample justification in
the late war," seems likely to be attempted by the gentleman who
is at present her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the
Colonies.&mdash;<i>April 22, 1879.</i></p>

<h3 class="p1">II.</h3>

<p class="pn p1">The Kafir war of 1835 was exceedingly disastrous to the colonists.
Shortly after it had commenced Colonel Smith (afterwards Sir
Harry Smith) wrote: "Already are 7000 persons dependent upon
the Government for the necessaries of life. The land is filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the lamentations of the widows and the fatherless. The indelible
impressions already made upon myself by the horrors of an irruption
of savages upon a scattered population, almost exclusively
engaged in the peaceful occupation of husbandry, are such as make
me look on those I have witnessed in a service of thirty years as
trifles to what I have now witnessed." The Kafirs were on this
occasion, as on every other, the aggressors, and plunder was the
principal motive of the war. Fifteen years previously Great
Britain had taken the responsibility of settling 5000 of her subjects
in the frontier districts of the Cape Colony, and then defence and
protection became both the duty and the interest of the home
country. With great exertions and after immense loss the war was
brought to a close. As a glorious trophy of the war no fewer than
15,000 Fingoes were literally saved from cruel captivity. The
Moses who led them out of their house of bondage was Sir
Benjamin D'Urban, and it was this wise and enlightened Governor
who annexed the province of Queen Adelaide, and determined that
the liberated people should be placed in this territory, so as to form
"the best barrier against the entrance of the Kafirs into the great
Fish River jungle." This extensive bush was the "quadrilateral"
of the Kafirs, and it was only acquired by the best blood of the
British and colonial troops.</p>

<p>During the whole period of the war of 1835 a very small section
of colonists had endeavoured to poison the minds of our Downing
Street rulers. Their arguments were based on several fictions,
including affirmations about violence on the part of colonists having
begot violence on the part of Kafirs, and that the great body of
Kafirs had never offended us. They even went so far as to make
use of glaring untruths respecting Hintza not having been engaged
in the war, and misled Lord Glenelg so much respecting the particulars
of that chief's death as to induce his lordship to make use
of expressions which he was afterwards compelled to retract. A
steady fire of prejudice, fed by pre-conceived ideas, constantly
existed at home in favour of the Kafir tribes&mdash;and indeed all
savages&mdash;which required very little effort to turn into a consuming
fire of anger and indignation. These little efforts were sedulously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
made and constantly continued in South Africa with the most
disastrous results. A number of well-meaning and prejudiced men,
who can be styled the Exeter Hall party, declaimed with virulence
against the colonists, and unfortunately Lord Glenelg was enrolled
among their number. This nobleman evidently considered that
humanitarian efforts were due to savages only, not to colonists, and
through his contemptible folly became the means of inflicting the
most severe injuries upon both. Sir Benjamin D'Urban, who was
completely master of the situation, and had proved himself an
honest and wise administrator, was entirely ignored, his policy was
stigmatized in the most insulting manner, and the sentimental ideas
of theorists made to take its place. In a despatch, dated 28th
December, 1835, the Secretary of State entirely exculpates the
Kafirs and censures both Sir Benjamin D'Urban and the colonists.
He says: "In the conduct which was pursued towards the Kafir
nation by the colonists, and the public authorities of the colony,
through a long series of years, the Kafirs had ample justification
of the late war; they had a perfect right to hazard the experiment,
however hopeless, of extorting by force that redress which they
could not expect otherwise to obtain; and the claim of sovereignty
over the new province, bounded by the Keiskamma and the Kei,
must be renounced. It rests upon a conquest resulting from a war
in which, as far as I am at present able to judge, the original
justice is on the side of the conquered, not of the conquering party."
The governor is severely reproved for styling the Kafirs "irreclaimable
savages," and the Wesleyan missionaries are also censured.
As a sequence the whole country between the Fish and
Buffalo rivers had to be handed over to the Kafirs, although that
portion of this territory which extended between the Fish and
Keiskamma rivers had been ceded by Gaika to the colony so far
back as the year 1819, and was therefore not conquered in the
recent war. The extraordinary fatuity of this course, judged from
a military point of view, is evident from the description of the
boundary furnished by Major Charters, military secretary to Sir
George Napier. This able officer says: "The line of frontier is all
in favour of the Kafirs; a dense jungle&mdash;the medium breadth is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
about five miles&mdash;torn and intersected by deep ravines, a great part
impenetrable except to Kafirs and wild beasts, occupies about one
hundred miles of frontier, following the sinuosities of the Great
Fish river. The whole British army would be insufficient to guard
it." In fact, this country comprised what, by analogy, may be
styled the Kafir quadrilateral, or combination of almost impregnable
fortresses. British and colonial blood had to be poured out as
water in the wars of 1845 and 1852 to recapture this country; but
fanaticism and prejudice are always impervious to argument.
"Their blood be upon us and upon our children" is a sentence
often repeated in history, so when the Waterloo veteran and gallant
British soldier, Sir Benjamin D'Urban, was dismissed for doing his
duty, Lord Glenelg defiantly wrote, "You announce to me the
abandonment of the province of Adelaide and cast on me the
responsibility of all the consequent disasters you predict. I am
perfectly ready to take upon myself the sole and exclusive responsibility
on this occasion."</p>

<p>It is difficult to find language sufficiently strong to stigmatize
the base perfidy and fatuous incompetency of the Glenelg policy.
A colony is acquired and its people exchange allegiance for protection;
later on 5000 British emigrants are placed in its frontier
districts. The savages in and beyond the borders of this country
are numerically far superior to our own subjects, and systematically
send in plundering bands who devastate the country and impoverish
the farmers. It is these savages who make war, and in defence it
is at last absolutely necessary either to repel the invaders or to
abandon the country. The case, let it be remembered, is not one
of emigrants seizing a country and then applying for protection.
It is the British Government which established its sovereignty first
and sent its emigrants afterwards. With immense exertion, and
at the cost of much blood and treasure, the savage tide is pushed
back&mdash;and then Lord Glenelg deliberately makes it flow again over
the conquered country, perfidiously becomes the ally and friend of
the savages and creates a cruel necessity&mdash;no other than that
of doing the work over again in the bloody wars of 1845 and 1852.
There is scarcely anything in history to form a parallel to this gross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
injustice and perfidy. Yet at the present moment a large party of
fanatical "philanthropists" in England are crying out for a repetition
of the same policy in Natal. The tide will be pushed back to
Cetywayo's kraal, but we must abandon the country after we
conquer it. The Zulu King made the war, and it is as purely one
of righteous self-defence as any ever waged in the world; yet we are
told that the colonists provoked it and are responsible for it! Sir
Bartle Frere is to be converted into Sir Benjamin D'Urban! and a
new edition of the Glenelg policy must be adopted by her Majesty's
Government!&mdash;<i>April 25, 1879.</i></p>

<h3 class="p1">III.</h3>

<p class="pn p1">Lord Glenelg emphatically stated that the Kafirs had perfect
justification for the war of 1835, and this affirmation was the
foundation of his entire policy. He identified himself with the
pseudo-philanthropists who looked upon the white inhabitants of
the Eastern districts as usurpers and persecutors. The ideas
of 1836 remain substantially the ideas of 1879, the only difference
being that the <i>venue</i> is changed and that the tide of savagery has
been pushed further eastward. The settlers of 1820 were placed
by the British Government on the frontier of the Cape Colony, and
on their part and that of their descendants there was certainly no
usurpation, while it positively seems to be the result of monomania
to speak of their having persecuted the Kafirs. The incontestable
facts of history prove exactly the opposite: it was the Kafirs that
harassed and persecuted them. A comparatively small, struggling,
and sparsely settled community was persistently tormented and
impoverished by most cruel thefts and constant aggressions, which
at last culminated in wars of defence most disastrous to the farmers
and the principal portion of the settlers. The stock, dwellings,
etc., of the poor border population destroyed in the war of 1835
alone were valued at upwards of £280,000! This was a cruel,
terrible infliction on those poor settlers, but it was not considered
enough by the Exeter Hall party. Christianity was blasphemed by
a policy of the grossest injustice adopted in its name. Those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
were bound by every tie of justice&mdash;putting aside charity&mdash;to
defend their own countrymen turned against them most virulently,
and did everything in their power to cause the re-enactment of the
bloody scenes in which British settlers in this distant land had
suffered so much.</p>

<p>In Mr. Godlonton's "Case for the Colonists" there is abundant
proof of the facts already adduced. The Kafirs were the aggressors
and the colonists the sufferers. Gross injustice, faithlessness,
rapine, and fraud&mdash;or in other words, <i>savagery</i>&mdash;had to be grappled
with, repelled, and conquered in the Cape Colony, and the pseudo-philanthropists
of England, headed by Lord Glenelg, did everything
in their power to aid and assist the latter cause. Perhaps the most
clear proof of the error of the British policy on which we are now
animadverting may be found in the evidence of one of Lord
Glenelg's chosen men and champions. Sir George Napier was
sent out specially to reverse the policy of Sir Benjamin D'Urban.
In answer to a Port Elizabeth address, he said, "I <i>decidedly</i> tell
you that I accepted the government of this colony in the conviction
that the former system, as regarded our Kafir neighbours, was
erroneous; and I am come out here, agreeing in, and determined
to support, the system of policy pursued by the Lieutenant-Governor
of these districts (Captain Stockenstrom) in accordance
with the instructions which his Honour and myself have received
from her Majesty's Secretary of State (Lord Glenelg)." Nothing
can be clearer than this, or more decided; but when Sir George
Napier learnt the facts of the case, the mist of prejudice dropped
from his eyes. Most fortunately, this officer was an honest man,
and dared to give his testimony in favour of the truth in spite of
his employers in England. He found that the policy he had been
directed to carry out "shocked one's natural sense of justice" (these
are his own words), and that he had been completely duped and
deceived. Referring to the aggressions of the Kafirs, Sir George
Napier says, "It would not be just to pass over the fact that while
much loss has been sustained by the colonists, as stated in the
official returns, I am not aware, except in one instance&mdash;and that
one of no importance&mdash;that any aggression has been committed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the border colonists against the persons or property of the neighbouring
tribes." It was at Port Elizabeth, and in the month of October,
1840, that Sir George Napier forcibly admitted that the Glenelg
treaties "seem to shock our sense of natural justice, and to be
unsupported by any considerations of sound policy." Speaking
subsequently to a gathering of the Slambie and Congo tribes of
Kafirs at Fort Peddie, his Excellency said, "You have sustained
no bad treatment on the part of the colonists, and I now appeal
to you whether the colonists have not kept their part of the treaties
ever since they were made? I ask if there has been a single act of
injustice of which you have any reason to complain on the part
of the Government and the colonists? You will answer, None. I
therefore appeal to you for justice towards the colonists." In fact,
Sir George Napier was forced to thoroughly change his opinions,
and it is unnecessary to multiply proofs of this well-known fact.
Would to God that Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, or even Sir Charles
Dilke, could come out to South Africa and report to the Home
Government so as to avert the awful catastrophe of surrendering
conquered Zululand to Cetywayo! This would be a suicide greater
in extent and more terrible even in its consequences than the
surrender of the province of Queen Adelaide by Lord Glenelg.
But surely if the world had been searched no more reliable man
than Sir Bartle Frere could have been chosen. He is a most
upright, wise, and experienced administrator; the friend of her
Majesty the Queen, and himself distinguished for all the qualities
which make men respected and trusted. He belongs to the
"Aborigines' Protection Society," and is in all respects above
suspicion, yet his most positive assurances weigh lightly in the
balance against the monomania existing among certain classes in
Europe, that savages must be right and colonists invariably wrong.
It is a bitter reflection that Zulu savagery finds its best allies among
the very people from whom we spring, and that the most deadly
enemies of the white people of South Africa are literally "those of
their own household."</p>

<p>One of the most able newspapers in South Africa echoes the
sentiments of Lord Glenelg, Dr. Philip, and Bishop Colenso. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
declares against annexation, and also against interference with the
usages of the native chiefs. It is said that to rule the Zulus
through their chiefs is the policy of her Majesty's Ministers. The
extraordinary admission is added that "order will be found better
than caprice and the law better than individual notions of right."
Surely we must admit that the rule of chiefs is purely a rule of
absolute caprice, and that the history of Cetywayo's government
specially proves it. The will of the monarch is the law of the land,
and bloody sacrifices constantly connected with witchcraft are purely
the effects of cruel and avaricious caprice. The entire history of
South Africa shows the folly and cruelty of the policy advocated by
the enemies of Sir Bartle Frere. No careful student of Cape history
can fail to see that the Glenelg plan of non-annexation was most
disastrous, while it was only when the power of the Gaika and
Gcaleka chiefs had been finally taken from them&mdash;and not till then&mdash;that
the people of this country, whites as well as blacks, could
hope to be finally released from the fearful curse of recurring thefts,
bloodshed, and wars. In fact history teaches plainly that to secure
peace, prosperity, and happiness to all the people of Southern Africa
it is absolutely necessary: (1.) To secure territorial guarantees,
such as those justly acquired in a war of defence by Sir Benjamin
D'Urban. (2.) To create a firmly knit and strong confederation of
colonies and states in which the Queen and just laws shall be
supreme, to the exclusion of witchcraft and the caprice of chiefs.</p>

<p>Incidentally, we may be permitted to illustrate what is really
meant by this "rule of chiefs." Every one knows that diabolical
and wholesale slaughter is a characteristic of the rule of all Zulu
potentates. Dingaan, Panda, Cetywayo, are all alike in this particular.
It is the system as much as the men that we have to
blame. Perhaps there is no more distinguishing proof of constant
cold-blooded and revolting cruelty arising directly and constantly
from the rule of chiefs than in the administration of the laws of
witchcraft. One example out of hundreds is sufficient. Missionaries
from time to time publish most revolting cases, but they are all of
the same type, and merely as a sample we refer our readers to the
one alluded to by Mr. Godlonton, at page 99 of his "Case for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Colonists." The son of a chief was sick, and a man of property was
immediately selected for torture and death, simply because the witch-doctor
said that it was under his evil influence that the sick man
was suffering. He begged and prayed for instant death, but of
course that boon is never granted. First of all the victim was held
to the ground, and several men pierced his body all over with Kafir
needles, two or three inches deep. The victim bore this with extraordinary
resolution, and his tormentors became tired, complaining of
the pain it gave their hands, and of the needles or skewers bending.
By this time a fire was kindled, into which large square stones were
placed to heat. His wife having first been cruelly beaten and ill-treated,
the victim was brought to the fire, laid on his back, with
his feet and hands tied to pegs driven into the ground. When the
stones became as hot as possible, they were placed upon his groin,
stomach, and chest. Then the scorching and broiling of the body
went on, the stones occasionally slipping off, and being immediately
replaced and held on by sticks. These awful tortures lasted from
10 a.m. to 6 p.m., when the unfortunate victim of the benefit of the
rule of the chiefs in South Africa breathed his last. We are asked
to perpetuate this system, and to surrender any conquered country
in Zululand, so that savagery may still continue without interruption,
and we may reap in Zululand from the policy of 1879 the fruits
obtained in 1845 and 1852 from the Glenelg policy of 1836.&mdash;<i>April
29, 1879.</i></p>

<h3 class="p1">IV.</h3>

<p class="pn p1">The great question of Sir Bartle Frere's native and Zulu policy is
easily narrowed. His Excellency believes in abolishing the power
of chiefs, and in obtaining after defensive war adequate territorial
guarantees. The opposite policy has, undoubtedly, caused the wars
of 1845, 1852, and 1877. The relinquishment of the province of
Queen Adelaide by Lord Glenelg necessitated its reconquest, and
the system of endeavouring to rule through the medium of chiefs
has resulted in disastrous failure. A chief is necessarily antagonistic
to civilization: all his power, influence, and means are obtained from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
savagery, and it is this latter system it is his interest to foster and
to continue. But for the astuteness and ability of Sir George Grey
Kreli would undoubtedly have thrown us into a serious war in 1857.
This great chief ordered cattle to be slaughtered in such a manner
as to prove that he had even determined to "burn his ships."
Emissaries were despatched to Moshesh, to Taku, and to the Tambookies.
A witch-doctor was used as a tool in the usual manner, so
as to stir up the people by means of superstition, and the system,
whose continuance is advocated by a party, only failed because of
the checkmate movements of the Governor. Subsequently, it was
purely the continuance of the system of the chiefs that led us into
the war of 1877. If their power had been abolished, as it should
have been, great calamities would have been averted from their own
people and from the Cape Colony. A careful honest study of
colonial history is all that is necessary to prove to demonstration
that weak half-measures with Kafirs are as irrational and absurd as
they are cruel. When we conquer we are bound to take away
entirely the pernicious powers of the chiefs, as well as to retain such
land guarantees as are really necessary for future safety. Those
who advocate this sound, wise policy are real philanthropists, substituting
justice and sound ideas for theoretical ideas, founded for
the most part upon that worst description of ignorance which is
founded upon prejudice and pre-conceived ideas.</p>

<p>One argument brought forward against Confederation is based
upon the lowest possible motives. It is the pockets, not the heads
or hearts, to which this earnest appeal is made. One great Government
in South Africa with provincial administrations will really be
too expensive! Besides, an objection is taken to the removal of the
liability under which the British Government labours at present.
Let the Home country continue to lose its best blood and treasure
rather than we should lose our money. A great strong Confederation
would put an end to Kafir wars by putting an end to the possibility
of their success, but lest we should have to pay a few more taxes
the British ratepayers' purses and the British soldiers' bodies must
continue to bleed. This infamous policy is not worthy of the
Colony of the Cape of Good Hope. We have attained our majority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
as children of the Empire, and we must be prepared to resume our
own responsibilities. These, unquestionably, include self-defence,
and to make that efficient the fable of the bundle of sticks must be
exemplified in the close union of all our states and colonies. Nothing
is more clear than the fact that all South Africa is like a draughtboard&mdash;the
blacks are on one side, the whites on the other. There
is no separating the interests of either combatants, so that when
Cetywayo fights against Natal, he fights against this colony as well
as against the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. But real
economy is always attended by a sound and statesmanlike system of
Government. There would be no recurrence of native wars under
Confederation, and this alone would be a source of great economy
and great prosperity. South Africa, not Downing Street, would
conduct its own native policy, and there would be then no fear of
the recurrence of such a policy as that of Lord Glenelg. At present
we are not safe, and the sooner such a period of incertitude and
danger is terminated the better for the taxpayers here and in England.
Are the people of this country not able to govern themselves
in a Confederation? The history of the separate states and colonies
proves the contrary. If we are able we ought to be willing, as such
a union means against the natives invincible strength, and consequently
both peace and economy. Above all things we ought to
relieve ourselves from the curse of being perpetually exposed to the
meddling and muddling of our native policy. Fatuous incompetency,
such as that of Lord Glenelg, is quite enough to ruin half a dozen
colonies, and we really can never be quite sure that it will not be
renewed.</p>

<p>A reference to Sir Bartle Frere's instructions proves very
clearly that his Excellency had incomparably more power than any
previous Governor-General or High Commissioner, and in acting as
he did under <i>carte blanche</i> authority, in no way exceeded his
powers. He had to choose between allowing the Zulu despot to
make war when he wished and in what manner he chose, or in
checkmating him by early action. The latter policy has been
adopted with Cetywayo as it was with Kreli, and in spite of a
temporary check will be the means of effectively protecting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
interests both of the British colonists and the British crown.
England never had a more faithful or conscientious officer than
Sir Bartle Frere, and a time will come when on the page of history
his name, with those of Sir Benjamin D'Urban and Sir George
Grey, will be blazoned as the greatest and most enlightened statesmen
who ever ruled in Southern Africa. "After me, the Deluge,"
would have been a convenient and very safe motto for each of these
men, but they scorned the wretched time-serving policy of shunting
off the evil day from themselves so as to allow its calamities
to accumulate into terrible magnitude and burst with awful force
upon their successors. But the principal defence of Sir Bartle
Frere's action and policy is to be found in his despatches, and to
them we earnestly beg careful and impartial attention.</p>

<p class="b1">The people of the Cape Colony and Natal are composed of
many races and of many creeds, but with the most insignificant
exceptions they all declare in the most emphatic manner in favour
of the policy of Sir Bartle Frere.</p>

<p class="ppq20">"Saxon and Celt and Dane are we,<br />
But all of us Danes in our welcome of thee."</p>

<p class="p1">From Capetown to the Tugela river and from L'Agulhas to the
Orange river one universal shout of sympathy and approval goes
forth to England. Resolutions, earnestly and emphatically declaring
that the High Commissioner is right, are sent to the foot of
the Queen's throne from Capetown, Port Elizabeth, Grahamstown,
Graaff-Reinet, Pietermaritzburg, D'Urban, and hosts of smaller
places. The newspaper press, with very few exceptions, constantly
and vigorously declares aloud the public sentiments. Surely all
this is a powerful argument. The people of South Africa, whose
lives, property, and character are at stake, may be trusted to take
such a lively interest in the entire subject as to understand it
thoroughly. Their interests and those of the United Kingdom are
thoroughly identical in this matter, and the sky does not so change
the mind even in this portion of the British Empire as to pervert
entirely the moral nature of so many of her Majesty's loyal
subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Political events connected with the Zulu war form incomparably
the most powerful argument that has yet been adduced in favour
of South African Confederation. We really cannot afford any
further Glenelg experiments, and so soon as we can knit ourselves
together in a powerful dominion we are by no means apprehensive
of the expense of fighting our own battles. In the first place we
would take care that there would be no chiefs to fight with, and
that witchcraft, tyranny, and other abominations should finally
cease. The natives would have to learn the habits of industry and
peace, and would be induced to substitute spades and ploughs for
guns and ammunition. A just, firm policy of this character, would
form a basis for Christianity, peace, and civilization, whereas the
senseless and fatuous plans of so-called philanthropists are as
destructive to the natives as they are injurious to the colonists and
to the British Empire of which they form a part.</p>

<p>It would be fortunate for South Africa if fair play were as much
the practice as it is the boast of Englishmen. There are many men
at home full of the same sentiments of righteous indignation as
those which animated Sir George Napier previous to his arrival in
South Africa. How few are there like that Governor, who will
consider it their duty to make themselves conversant with the
subject, and then be guided by their conscientious convictions.
The cause at issue is simply savagery <i>versus</i> civilization, and before
a verdict is given the entire evidence and arguments ought to be
attentively heard and carefully considered. Colonists do not desire
war, but an end of all war. They are most anxious to save, not
to destroy, the savages, and the wise statesmanship of such men as
Sir Benjamin D'Urban, Sir George Grey, and Sir Bartle Frere is
<i>absolutely necessary</i> for this purpose.&mdash;<i>May 2, 1879.</i></p>

<p class="pn center mid">IMPORTANT DESPATCH FROM SIR BARTLE FRERE.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">The following despatch from Sir Bartle Frere, dated Pietermaritzburg,
February 12, has been issued as a parliamentary
paper:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">"Sir,&mdash;In my despatch of January 24th last, I only partially
answered your despatch of December 18th. I was, in fact, interrupted
while writing by the intelligence of our disaster at the headquarter
camp on the 22nd, and was obliged to close my unfinished
despatch to be in time for the mail. The very serious check which
we received on the 22nd does not, however, seem to me to call for
any modification in the opinions I had already ventured to lay before
her Majesty's Government; on the contrary, it seems to confirm
most strongly the arguments I had already advanced in my despatch
of the 24th, to show that it was impossible, with any regard to the
safety of these colonies, to defer placing in the hands of the general
commanding her Majesty's forces the enforcement of the demands
made on Cetywayo. Deeply as, in common with every subject of
her Majesty, I deplore the disastrous check we have received, it is
impossible to shut one's eyes to the fact that it was, in all human
probability, mainly due to disregard of the general's orders that so
great a disaster occurred; whilst every circumstance accompanying
or following the events of that day proves what an insecure position
we occupied both here and in the Transvaal with such a neighbour
along so many hundred miles of undefended frontier. As a consequence
of the crippling of Colonel Glyn's and Colonel Durnford's
columns, and the shock which has been given to the colonial forces,
Europeans as well as natives, the columns of Colonel Pearson and
Colonel Wood have been obliged to suspend their advance and
await reinforcements, which can only be looked for to the extent
required from more distant parts of South Africa and from England.
It has become painfully evident that the Zulu king has an army at
his command, which could almost any day unexpectedly invade
Natal, and, owing to the great extent of frontier and utter helplessness
of the undisciplined hordes of Natal natives to offer effectual
resistance, the Zulus might march at will through the country,
devastating and murdering, without a chance of being checked, so
long as they abstained from attacking the entrenched posts of her
Majesty's troops, which are from fifty to a hundred miles apart.
The capital and all the principal towns are at this moment in
'laager,' prepared for attack, which, even if successfully resisted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
would leave two-thirds of them in ashes, and the country around
thoroughly desolated. From every part of South Africa outside the
colony, where the native races predominate, come the same reports
of uneasiness and of intended rising of the native race against the
white man; whilst the majority of the Transvaal European population
is in a state of avowed readiness to take any opportunity of
shaking off the yoke of the English Government. It may be said
that these are only the stronger reasons why hostilities should not
have been commenced with the Zulu king. But I submit that
every circumstance which has lately occurred shows how impossible
it is to defer hostilities for more than a few weeks at the utmost,
possibly till the harvest now ripening was gathered, and till the
Tugela was fordable. The feeling which has just burst out, both
among native tribes and in the Transvaal, was there already, and in
the Transvaal, at all events, its expression could not have been
deferred by any postponement of hostilities with the Zulus. But
what possible chance was there that Cetywayo himself would for
any length of time have remained quiescent within his own borders?
He had not acknowledged officially, and in the usual form, the award
of the disputed territory in his favour, nor had he condescended even
to discuss the terms of the High Commissioner's messages to him.
Had Lord Chelmsford's large force been kept permanently on his
frontier, he might possibly have refrained from action as long as
this force remained. But its permanent retention was not, as
Cetywayo knew, probable, and the removal of the force would
assuredly have led to a renewal of the encroachments and the
violations of the territory which he had directed or acquiesced in
during the preceding year and a half; the slightest accident might
have led to a collision taking us at a disadvantage, and what he had
the power to do in a colony so little prepared for self-defence may
be judged from what he has done since her Majesty's troops crossed
the border. It seems to me vain, I had almost said criminal, to shut
our eyes to the fact that there has grown up, by our sufferance,
alongside this colony, a very powerful military organization, directed
by an irresponsible, bloodthirsty, and treacherous despot, and that
as long as this organization exists and is so directed it is impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
for peaceful subjects of her Majesty to feel security of life or property
within fifty miles of his border. The existence of this military
organization makes that of a peaceful English community in his
neighbourhood impossible, and unless Cetywayo's power of murder
and plunder be restrained, this colony can only continue to exist as
an armed camp. Again, it may be said that before attempting to
coerce Cetywayo the presence of a large force in the field should
have been secured. To this I can only answer that though a larger
force might undoubtedly have lessened the chance of successful
opposition, there was no reason whatever at the time to suppose
that the force at our disposal was too small for the task attempted.
I will not dwell on what might have been the case had orders been
obeyed, and had things happened otherwise than they did happen.
I stand on the broad fact that I sought information in every possible
quarter, and had, and have, no reason whatever to suppose that
there was anything rash in the undertaking. I know of no one
who is supposed to know the Zulus whose advice had not been as
fully heard as I could obtain it. Of the three persons who, among
unofficial as well as official authorities, are supposed best to know
the Zulus, their feelings and probable intentions, one expressed to
me his own belief in the ultimate acceptance of the terms offered
without fighting; another considered we had, in our military calculations,
greatly over-estimated the Zulu power; and a third, who
had perhaps better means of judging than any one else, whilst
agreeing that the Zulu power had been much overrated, was convinced
that the Zulu people themselves would bring their tyrant to
reason, and that, after a single action or two, the military system of
the Zulus would collapse. It is a singular coincidence that the latter
opinion was expressed to me on the 22nd, at the very time that our
camp at Isandala was in possession of the Zulus. Looking back on
the past in the light of what has happened, I cannot think the work
was rashly undertaken. But even if I could have hoped that further
reinforcements could be expected within a reasonable time in answer
to a call for them, there was no time to wait. No one who had
carefully studied the events of the last two years, and knew the
ways of these barbarians, could reasonably have expected the Zulus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
to remain quiet, and it was clear that, even if they deferred action,
there were elements of strife elsewhere which could not be evaded
or delayed. As I have said before, and in other communications,
the die for peace or for war had been cast more than two years ago.
It was a simple question whether we should steadily bring our
differences to an issue on a clear and unmistakable demand for our
right to live at peace with our neighbours, or whether we should
await the convenience of the Zulu king, and be taken at disadvantage
when he saw his opportunity. It seems to me that this same
principle of self-preservation and self-defence should be steadfastly
adhered to in all our future proceedings. It may be quite possible
to patch up a peace with this or that tribe, which shall for the time
be more or less satisfactory to some of the interests in this or in a
neighbouring colony. But I submit that her Majesty's Government
should not permit peace to be made till her Majesty's unquestioned
supremacy has been established and recognized by all Zulu tribes
who now acknowledge Cetywayo between this and the Portuguese
territory around Delagoa Bay. This I firmly believe to be the only
guarantee for peace, security, good government, and progressive
civilization throughout her Majesty's possessions and all neighbouring
territories in South Africa; and without such security I feel
assured that this colony of Natal can never be a safe residence for
peace-loving and civilized men of European descent.</p>

<p class="ppl10">3rd.&mdash;The Cape, Natal, and Zanzibar Mail Service.</p>

<p class="ppl10 p1">CAPE MAIL SERVICE.&mdash;The Packets leave Plymouth (under Contract
with the Cape of Good Hope Government) every alternate Friday,
sailing from Southampton the preceding day. The days for departure
from Cape Town homeward are every alternate Tuesday. The time
occupied between Plymouth and Cape Town is about 22 days.</p>

<p class="pn center lmid">SANITATION.</p>


<p class="pn center lmid">BANNER'S PATENT</p>

<p class="pn center lmid">VENTILATING COWL.</p>

<p class="reduct"><i>No House having a Water Closet in
it should be without one fixed on the
Soil Pipe carried above the Roof, and
for the Ventilation of Public Buildings
and Rooms they surpass any Ventilator
yet introduced.</i></p>

<p class="pn center p1 lmid">OPINIONS OF THE PRESS, Etc.</p>

<p class="reduct">"Ventilate! Ventilate! Ventilate!"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Public Health.</span></p>

<p class="reduct p1">"The word 'impossible' has ceased to exist in the vocabulary
of the sanitary reformer; if a prevalent evil ought to
be removed, it can be removed."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Times.</span></p>

<p class="reduct p1">"The system devised by Mr. Banner is as near perfection
as may be: nothing better need be desired. By means of
this simple apparatus the <i>foul air</i> in <i>any shaft</i> will be continuously
extracted."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sanitary Record.</span></p>

<p class="reduct p1">"We believe Mr. Banner's system of sanitation will make
any house absolutely safe from sewer gas or noxious odours
of any description from the drains or closets."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Architect.</span></p>

<p class="reduct p1">"One lesson which Mr. Banner has learned, namely,
that to make a ventilating-pipe of constant avail air must be
introduced at the bottom, is of itself a boon of value."&mdash;<span class="smcap">The
Builder.</span></p>

<p class="reduct p1">"A thorough current of air is constantly maintained by an
inlet placed just above the trap, and an outlet above the
roof, to which is annexed the cowl, preventing any downdraught.
A velocity of 510 feet per minute was registered by
an anemometer under very ordinary circumstances."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Building
News.</span></p>

<p class="reduct p1">"The conclusion I have come to after a considerable
time spent upon their study is, that Banner's Sanitary
Appliances are the best media extant for the work which
they are intended to compass, that I can confidently recommend
them, and that they ought to be specified by architects
generally."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wm. Eassie, C.E.</span>, author of "Sanitary Arrangements
for Dwellings."</p>

<p class="reduct p1">"Mr. Banner's system thoroughly effects what it proposes&mdash;namely,
to render houses wholesome which are now mere
deadly fever-traps, whether they be mansions in Belgravia or
cottages in the suburbs."&mdash;<span class="smcap">John P. Seddon, F.R.I.B.A.</span></p>

<p class="reduct p1">"Mr. Banner's system fulfils all the conditions specified in
the contract. There is no foul air generated. The several
currents in the soil-pipe, in the drain, and in the large
sewers&mdash;a channel of 350 feet in length&mdash;have uniformly been
found to be flowing in the right direction whenever they
have been tested; and this has been done repeatedly."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Guy's
Hospital Gazette.</span></p>

<p class="reduct p1">"I believe in your cowls, and I think that probably I am
as impartial a judge as can be had, yet I candidly confess that
if I knew of a better cowl I would most certainly employ it."&mdash;<span class="smcap">H.
H. Collins, F.R.I.B.A.</span></p>

<p class="reduct p1">"Your system at the Royal Infirmary, Ryde, continues to
act perfectly, and I am applying it everywhere."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Thos.
Hellyer, F.R.I.B.A.</span></p>

<p class="reduct p1">"The system introduced by Mr. Banner has now undergone
a crucial test, and can only be looked upon as a great <i>fait
accompli</i>."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Metropolitan.</span></p>

<p class="reduct p1">"I must say, in justice to Mr. Banner, that the greatest
possible credit is due to him for having succeeded in solving
a problem which has hitherto baffled all the combined talent
of the best sanitary authorities of the day."&mdash;Major <span class="smcap">H. C.
Seddon, R.E.</span>, War Office.</p>

<hr class="tb1" />

<p class="reduct p1">The system is substantially recommended by the Local Government Board, and should be universally
adopted. Amongst a number of important places far too numerous to mention, the system has been
applied, wholly or partially, at Marlborough House, Stafford House, Burghley, Crom Castle, Kylemore
Castle; Guy's, Ryde, West Herts, Middlesex, and other Hospitals; Bank of England, City Bank,
Standard Bank of Africa, and other Banks; at Radcliffe College, Oxford; Presbyterian College, Bloomsbury;

Although this poor victim implored for death, it was not granted
to him until he had been literally roasted. Red-hot stones were placed on
his groin, and when they slipped off, were held in position by means of
sticks. Another very common torture is that of smearing a victim, and
then allowing him to be slowly eaten up by black ants or scorpions, whose
thousand bites and stings produce lingering and excruciating torture. All
these infernal proceedings take place in connection with the spiritualist

With reference to the disputed Transvaal land awarded to Cetywayo,
it has been argued that the territory in question should have been handed
over to this savage potentate without any reference to the rights of private
proprietors who had settled down and acquired domiciles. The Chief
Justice of the Cape Colony, Sir J. H. De Villiers (Blue Book, July, 1879),
gives a very lengthy and interesting opinion upon this subject. His Honour
holds that if negotiations had been entered into between the British
Government and Cetywayo for the purpose of a convention defining the
mutual rights of the parties, the equitable view would have been entitled
to as much weight as the legal view. The arguments used by Sir Bartle
Frere are so weighty, that if they had been addressed to a potentate who
is capable of understanding them, and at the same time is open to reason,
they would certainly have induced him to relinquish his private rights to
the land, retaining only his sovereign rights.</p></div>

Henry Evelyn Wood, V.C., C.B., of the 90th Regiment, and commanding
the column at Kambula, entered the Royal Navy in 1852, and
served in the Naval Brigade as A.D.C. to Captain Peel, of the <i>Shannon</i>, from
1st October, 1854, to 18th January, 1855, when he was severely wounded
carrying up scaling ladders to the Redan. He was mentioned in Lord
Raglan's despatches (medal with clasps, Knight of the Legion of Honour,
5th Class of the Medjidie and Turkish medal). He next served in the
Indian campaign of 1858 in the 17th Lancers, and as brigade-major in
Somerset's Brigade, and was present at Rajghur, Sindwaho (mentioned in
General Michel's despatches), Kharie, and Barode, mentioned in despatches
(medal). In 1859-60 he was employed, while commanding 1st Regiment
Beatson's Horse, in hunting down rebels in the Seronge jungles; thanked
by the Indian Government for his services, and received the Victoria
Cross. He raised the 2nd Regiment Central Indian Horse. Accompanied
Sir Garnet Wolseley to the Gold Coast in September, 1873, on special
service, and served throughout the Ashantee war of 1873-4. Organized the
natives forming "Wood's Regiment." Commanded the attacking force at
the action of Essaman (received the expression of her Majesty's approbation).
Commanded the troops at the head of the road, following the enemy
from Mansu to the river Piah, prior to the arrival of the European troops,
including the reconnaisance in force of the 27th November. Commanded
the right column at the battle of Amoaful (slightly wounded), and commanded
the head-quarters of his regiment at the battle of Ordahsu and
capture of Coomassie (several times mentioned in despatches, brevet of
colonel, C.B., medal with clasps). His Victoria Cross was gained for
having, on the 19th of October, 1858, during action at Sandwaho, when in
command of a troop of the 3rd Light Cavalry, attacked with much gallantry,
almost single-handed, a body of rebels who had made a stand, whom he
routed. Also, for having, subsequently, near Sindwaho, gallantly advanced
with a duffadar and sowar of Beatson's Horse, and rescued from a band of
robbers a potail, Chemmum Singh, whom they had captured and carried off
to the jungles, where they intended to hang him.</p></div>

May, 1879, says, "It is my deliberate opinion that were the Zulus to cross
the Tugela in force anywhere between Toohey's Drift and Fort Buckingham,
they might avoid the military and make a raid into Natal easily. The
general commanding has done all in his power to protect the border, by
placing native guards, under white men, all along it; but their only use
will be to give the alarm in case the Zulus attack. I have seen many of
them, and I have asked them what they will do if the Zulus make an attack.
'Run, of course,' was the reply; and I have heard&mdash;not from them, but from
a third person&mdash;that they have said, 'If our officers order us to cross the
Tugela unsupported by white troops, we shall tell them to kill us in Natal,
and save themselves the trouble of taking us to Zululand to be killed.' I
therefore look upon the border guard as utterly worthless as a means of
defence, and two at least of the volunteers at Thring's Post&mdash;intelligent
men they are&mdash;entirely agree with me.
</p>
<p class="pfn">
"What may be the state of affairs at Cetywayo's kraal I know not; but
this I do know, namely, that all along the Tugela border the Zulus have
returned to and occupied their kraals, and that they sometimes shout
defiance and exchange shots with the border guards."</p></div>

cannot fail to be of interest. Having assumed command on April 15th,
he directed his first attention to Luneberg, where he arrived with Colonel Bray,
C.B., about the middle of May, when he reconnoitred in preparation for an
attack upon Tafelberg (Umbellini's caves), accompanied by Captain Moore,
4th Regiment, and an orderly. They got too far within the enemy's lines,
and with river and a dangerous donga between them, on the road back to
camp found themselves attacked by about fifty Zulus, all armed with Martini-Henry
rifles. The commandant was unarmed, except his British bull-dog
(a little revolver). His horse was shot under him; Captain Moore's fell, also
shot down dead. The orderly mounted behind the commandant was thrown
again and again, whilst the Zulus came closer and closer. At last the orderly
got somewhat confused and could not be remounted. He went down to the
river to find a hole where he could eventually defend himself; Captain
Moore then mounted behind the commandant, and after a fearful ride
through the Zulus' bullets, which whistled about them like hailstones, they
at last gained the camp. Without a minute's delay he started off with
twenty mounted men to the relief of Larson (the name of the orderly).
Alas! the poor fellow had disappeared. All searching was in vain, not the
vestige of a spoor could be detected. On May 20th Tafelberg was attacked.
One hundred Zulus in well-entrenched positions poured in a deadly fire.
Lieutenant Gown, of the 4th Regiment, distinguished himself in a gallant
charge, and the enemy were driven back into their caves and holes.&mdash;Extract

<p class="pfn"><a name="Footnote_36_36" id="Footnote_36_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> The following information is from a colonist whose character and experience
render him an unexceptionable witness. He says, "As a resident of
many years in Zululand, I have had some experience and means of observation.
The year before the Commission sat at Rorke's Drift, the chief Usirayo
built his head kraal at Usogexe, and a strong stone wall with loopholes
round it; and his people often told me that they hoped to use them against
the white men. They often talked about war; and I more than once remonstrated
with Usirayo and his people, telling them that they should take
care not to bring about a war with 'abelungu' (the white men), as it would
be worse for themselves, but in vain, as they felt confident in their guns and
their numbers. Cetywayo once sent an ox-hide to Sir T. Shepstone, and
said, if he could count the hair on it, he would perhaps be able to form an
idea of the number of the Zulu warriors; but I do not think the hide
reached its destination. When the Commission was sitting at Rorke's Drift,
Usirayo threatened to destroy the men and tents, if they came across the
Buffalo to inspect the border line, near Usirayo's head kraal, where you still
see the stone heaps left since the beacons. I warned the Commission
through a missionary, and the late Colonel Durnford noted it. The Zulus
have bought their thousands of guns, for the purpose of using them against
the whites; have bought most of their ammunition with the same intention;
have engaged people from Basutoland to teach them to make powder; and
they have had a good deal of training in shooting. When Umbellini committed
his first massacre at Umpongolo&mdash;I think in 1877&mdash;he went to the
king, who adorned him with the usual sign of an 'iqawe' (a plucky and
brave fellow); so it seems to be little use in saying the king did not agree
with the rascal in his doings, as somebody seems to mean. Why did the
king allow Usirayo and his people to steal horses, cattle, and sheep from
the Boers, year after year, without punishing them? Why did he not at
once punish Usirayo and his men, for crossing the border with arms last
winter, and dragging away the poor women, who had fled for their lives?
Why has he tried to rouse other tribes against the whites? Why did he not
care for the promises made at the coronation? He wished for war, and he
has got it; and that which brought him to that madness is chiefly this:
First, that he despised the Gospel, of which he knows a good deal, and
would not allow his people to become Christians; secondly, because the
Christian Government would not allow him to make war upon other tribes,
as his forefathers had done; and thirdly, his strong belief that he should
succeed in exterminating the whites, because he thought them only a handful,
and his own soldiers as plentiful as grass&mdash;which phrase he often uses
with regard to them in conversation. Could he but get rid of the whites,
he would soon subdue the black tribes&mdash;that has been his hope. And now
we must be thankful to God, who sent such a man as Sir Bartle Frere to
save the colonists from such a blow as Cetywayo intended to have aimed at
them."</p></div>

<p class="pfn"><a name="Footnote_37_37" id="Footnote_37_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> Paragraphs such as the following would frequently recur. A correspondent
at the Lower Tugela writes, in May, "Knowing that the reinforcements
have arrived, looking at and counting the forces now in the field,
seeing the waggon road full of starving oxen which will very soon be unable
to work, while the grass grows dry and scarce, and no sign is seen of the
troops being ready to move, the talk in the papers of months being likely to
pass before any operation can begin again, etc., really makes you sad and
despairing, and causes you to fear that the whole Zulu war will be a failure.
If any of the successes the English troops have had could have been followed
up by speedy advances, the war would have been finished long ago; but as
it is, it gives the enemy plenty of time to collect and reorganize, thinking
that the English, checked by some unknown difficulties, must give it up at
last altogether. If the campaign is to be directed from home it will be a
failure, without doubt. Had the troops been able to advance a fortnight
ago, we might now have seen something of the end of the war. This lingering
cannot but have a bad effect upon the enemy, keeping up their hopes of
an ultimate success.

<p class="pfn">
"Transport is more and more the bugbear. As we point out elsewhere,
the simple fact is that the resources of the country are overstrained. Young
and untrained cattle are, in many cases, being employed, at a very serious
risk of loss. We are glad to learn, indirectly, that the proceedings of the
commission of enquiry go to show that cost and difficulties of transport are
at the bottom of the high charges complained of, and that the question is
really one of supply and demand. The commissariat are now employing
1800 waggons, and want 200 more very urgently. There is, we believe,
much exaggeration in the statements put forth as to the exorbitant charges
made upon the commissariat. However, we await the report of the commission
with much interest."</p></div>

at 5 a.m. as usual; the men dispersed at 6.30 to drink the warm
coffee prepared for them. Shortly after the disperse was sounded, to the
annoyance of every one in camp, the enjoyment of their coffee was spoilt by
the assembly being sounded; the tents were lowered, the cavalry saddling
up and riding some 200 yards from camp. The utility of this man&oelig;uvre
was not apparent to the troops, being at an unreasonable time. In Wood's
column the alarm is invariably sounded about sunset after a new laager has
been formed, in order that every one might know at night what waggon he
is stationed at, without creating confusion. If a night attack should be
made, everything is so slovenly and loosely carried out here that we pray
for the return of General Wood, to rejoin our own column; for then we
feel that we should be safer from our enemies than we are from our friends.
This column has too much gold lace and red tape about it for South African
warfare. The contrast between the two columns is very striking in many
things, more especially in the punctilious military etiquette of this column,
where on every side one is likely to be stopped by the sentry, and told that
you must not go through a row of huts because a staff tent is under his
charge. At head-quarters, plebeian's feet must not intrude within a certain
distance. With General Wood's column there are no sentries over staff
tents; the only day sentries are over Government stores, the regimental
colours, and guard tents. All the staff tents display flags, denoting that
business is done there, and they are open to the approach of every one who
may have business to transact. General Wood, Colonel Buller, and their
officers, have no pride or affectation. As a rule the officers of all branches
of the service follow the example of their commanders, and are as courteous
and friendly as they are brave."</p></div>

<p class="pfn"><a name="Footnote_46_46" id="Footnote_46_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> The following graphic description of the pursuit of stragglers, and a
narrow escape from falling into a Zulu trap, will be read with interest:&mdash;"During
the first two days the king made no sign, and his people were marching,
drilling, and performing war-dances in a fashion that did not strike me as
being very pacific. On the day the armistice expired at noon (July 3rd),
the question was solved in a way that must at least have convinced even
Lord Chelmsford himself, that Cetywayo had been making a fool of him.
Early in the morning (about 9 a.m.), lurking Zulus crept down to the strong
kopje commanding the drift, and fired on the soldiers, who were washing
and bathing in the river below. There was a great panic and scamper, but
I believe no one was wounded. That, however, was not all, for some of them
came across the river and drove off fifty trek oxen which were feeding,
taking them over the river and some distance up the opposite bank. The
cattle guard promptly crossed and recaptured them, but up to noon our
camp was insulted by the impudent rascals firing at us, and some few of the
Martini-Henry bullets actually fell in the camp and laager. This was carrying
things too far, and at noon Buller's brigade was ordered out to try and
cut off a few of them. We crossed the river at a drift below the camp, and
galloping round the base of the hill, tried to pick off a few; but we were
too late. They had seen our preparations and were off, and we saw them
racing off near Nodwengu. We started in pursuit, and on nearing the kraal
we overtook the rear fugitive. There was a race to get him, amongst half a
dozen of us, but he fell to Lord William Beresford, who gave point with his
sabre, just as the Zulu turned to use his assegai, running him through the
shield and through the body. We then turned and galloped after the others,
at least 150, whom we should have cut off had everything been on the
square; but the black rascals were leading us into a nice trap, which had
been laid for the express purpose. Half-way between Nodwengu and
Ulundi there is a sluggish spruit, with a deep bed, which runs parallel with
this road for some distance, and then turns sharply across it at right angles.
I had doubts when I saw some of these fugitives disappear in the spruit
bed, and these doubts became certainty when I heard Buller shout out to
'retire,' and almost at the same moment, before we could get our horses up
and round, two lines of Zulus rose in the spruit bed and poured in a volley
within 100 yards. If they had known how to shoot, which happily for us
they do not, nearly every saddle ought to have been emptied; but only three
men and half a dozen horses were over. Lord William Beresford took up a
dismounted man, and Commandant D'Arcy one who was wounded. The
former got his man out safely; the latter, I am sorry to say, was thrown by
his horse bucking at the unaccustomed burden. The poor trooper was overtaken
and killed, while the commandant was so severely bruised from falling
on his revolver, that he was able to get back safe, but not able to take part
in the next day's fight. It is hardly necessary to say that we galloped back
at least as fast as we had come, perhaps even a little faster, for we were
seen and pursued, Zulus springing up from the grass in all directions and
firing continuously. We ran the gauntlet the whole way back, making only
one rally on a crest sprinkled with small trees. The line in our rear was
500 yards off, and some of them were shot, but we were not able to stop
very long, for we saw columns making for the drift to cut us off. Happily
Colonel Buller had left Baker and his men on the stony kopje to cover our
retreat, and his men peppered one of these intercepting columns so effectually
as to stop their advance. Our peril was seen from the camp, and
Major Le Grice's battery of 9-pounders took up a position on the high ground
in front, from which they so astonished the other column of Zulus by a well-directed
fire of shrapnel at long range, that they too were prevented from
carrying out their philanthropic intention. We had only, therefore, the pursuing
Zulus to deal with, but they followed up closely as far as the ford,
where Captain Whalley, with the Natal Light Horse, drew up and covered our
crossing. It is a marvel to me, considering the heavy fire that we were
under, that we only lost three men killed, four wounded, and thirteen horses
missing."</p></div>

letters is a trader. The king has his movements always watched." Speaking
of the result of the battle of Ulundi, he said, "The army is now thoroughly
beaten, and, as we were beaten in the open, it will not reassemble
or fight again."</p></div>

<p class="pfn"><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> The Gatlings were not very successful. Firing had to cease six times
during the action, as they got overheated.</p></div>

<p class="pfn"><a name="Footnote_49_49" id="Footnote_49_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> Sir Garnet Wolseley was at dinner at Fort Pearson when the news
of the victory of Ulundi was received, and a correspondent who was present
thus describes its reception:&mdash;"As we sat at dinner we discussed all the
probabilities and possibilities of the situation. Had Lord Chelmsford
embarked upon a desperate enterprise of his own? What if success should
not be his? And when we thought of Isandhlwana our reflections were
gloomy. We were still at dinner when a despatch was handed to Sir Garnet,
and as he read it his face broke into a smile, and looking up cheerfully
he said, 'This is indeed the best news I have read for many a long day.
To-night, gentlemen, we may sleep peacefully, for Lord Chelmsford has been
engaged with the army of the Zulu king, and has thoroughly defeated it."
The despatch was from Mr. Sivewright, the general manager of the telegraph
in South Africa. Sir Garnet read us the sentence, short, clear, and decisive,
showing us how Cetywayo in person had made his final effort to save his
kingdom, and was now a refugee and an outcast from his nation in the
black swamps of the Umvolosi. The despatch was read by order of the
general to the troops; and borne by the high wind across the waters of
the Tugela into Zululand went the British cheers which announced the
fall of the bold, brave, cruel, and crafty king. We slept soundly that
night."</p></div>

<p class="pfn"><a name="Footnote_50_50" id="Footnote_50_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> "Some 2000 Zulus have been employed by the general as carriers, on
the same principle as he adopted in the Ashantee campaign. It has proved
a great success, and saved tremendous expense in transport. They receive
twenty shillings per month, and rations. Every man carries fifty-six pounds
at a time. This system has caused some discontent among the Natal Native
Contingent, who complain that after these men fighting against us the
Government are paying and allowing them the same privilege as themselves.
But considering these men don't do half the work the carriers do,
and having a natural failing for grumbling, no notice is taken of their
complaint."</p></div>

others had done, and when landed on deck gave vent to a sigh, whether of
despondency or relief could only be guessed. He would not go near the
ship's side, and grasped at the officer's hand to support him while standing
on the deck. He was asked to look out to see the anchor weighed, but
declined to do so, though manifesting a childlike curiosity about many
things on board. Various trappings, such as blankets and mats, were
brought on board, the king having two mattresses and two blankets
supplied by the military, and the men and women one blanket and mattress
each. The prisoners soon became reconciled to their situation on board,
and began to manifest much interest in all they saw and heard. A kraal,
about twelve feet square, was rigged up on the fore part of the poop deck,
where there was less motion to the ship and plenty of breeze. The king's
women and servants were placed in here with himself, and were made as
comfortable as possible. He retired to his kraal soon after coming on board,
and did not come out till next day, when the officers showed him through
the ship. He expressed his great surprise and admiration at many of the
things he saw, and was especially struck with the machinery. He would
not go down into the engine-room, but gave a token of his wonder at the
works of the white men by giving utterance to the peculiar Kafir "Whouw!"
He could not comprehend the use of many of the appliances of the cabin,
and although he believed the account given to him of how the ship was
made, and how much it cost, the processes were a mystery to him and the
amount a fable. His first question with regard to the ship was how old she
was and "how many cattle she cost." He had a great objection to coming
to the Cape, as his spies and messengers had brought up an evil report of
the land in times past. Cetywayo expressed his perfect resignation to his
fate, and said he knew from the first the war would end as it did, and that
he himself would be the sufferer. He blamed his young men, whom he
could not restrain at the beginning, and also blamed the English for pursuing
the war to its present conclusion.</p></div>
